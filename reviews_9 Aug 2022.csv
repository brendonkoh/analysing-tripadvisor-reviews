"Fine views of the river and viaduct"
"Easy to find if you park in one of the main town centre car parks. Free to walk around and some of the finest views you'll find in the UK. Museum and castle keep entry combined is £3.50 which was very reasonable. My only issue is the potentially unlawful and discriminatory practice operated by Harrogate Council by enforcing card payments only. No cash can be used to pay for entry or to buy anything from the museum gift shop. The keep itself wasn't much to explore but for £3.50 and the museum included it was worth it."
"Lovely remains of such a  historic site"
"We enjoyed walking around the castle and surrounding gardens with their amazing history and beautiful views. We loved this twon and definitely hope to return soon."
"For the best views of the viaduct!"
"Wonderful free to enter attraction, very well maintained gardens and breath taking views of the viaduct, not to be missed!"
"Remains to be seen"
"Charming remains with a fantastic view of the river and viaduct. Old courthouse museum interesting, but the tiny ruined keep not really worth the effort as it's so small. Parking nearby might be a bit difficult."
"Worth the climb"
"So glad we decided to make the climb up to the castle, you are rewarded with the most spectacular views of the viaduct and beyond."
"Spectacular Views From The Castle"
"Came here over the Jubilee Holiday. Nice walk up to the Castle from the Riverside.Spectacular views from the top. I started at the Museum which displays interesting facts about the Castle and the surrounding area. The Court room is the original one used complete with the trap door where prisoners were led up to stand trial.Short walk to the Castle. Entrance takes you into the main service room. Upstairs to the King's Chambers be careful on the steps. Downstairs to the dungeon.Admission is £3.50 concessions for Seniors and children. There is a car park next to the Police Station. Not expensive.Good for all of the family.Well worth a visit. I enjoyed my day."
"A good spot to take pics"
"It gives a beautiful view of the whole place . The castle itself is small but has beautiful gardens that make a good walk."
"Free attraction!"
"Great free attraction in the heart of Knaresborough, beautiful gardens to walk around with great views of the Viaduct! "
"Stunning views"
"Just a stunning place.Incredible views, fascinating history. Feel the council could do even more with it, maybe using some of the outdoor area immediately outside the castle.Must visit!"
"Great space and views"
"This is a great open space, especially on a sunny day as it was. There are ruins around but also lots of space to sit, have a picnic, etc. There are good views down to the river and across to the railway bridge.There are steps and path down to the river from here which is good too - just remember you have to get back up them!"
"A good time in court"
"We have been to the castle on many occasions but had never visited the jailhouse museum. It is quite small but packs in a lot in a small space. The information about Blind Jack was especially worthwhile and the guides were most helpful."
"Not much there beyond the views"
"The views from the grounds over the viaduct and river are good, though strictly you don't need to be on the castle grounds to get those views (you can also get them just outside the castle grounds).There's not much to see of the castle itself but you can walk the grounds for free."
"Worth the time to take a look & drink in the view below!"
"The castle grounds offer fabulous views of the viaduct & river below. You can park in a short stay car park adjacent to the castle but we opted to park in the long stay by the river & walk up the steep hill. You can’t go in the castle but it’s an internet ruin. Courthouse museum (£2 entry) & war memorial in the garden is interesting. There are different routes up the hill  to the castle that include steps or a steep slope. There is no charge to visit the castle ruin."
"Fabulous views "
"The Castle gets a 4 for the views alone.There's little left of the castle itself but there are information boards around the site and there's no charge.Definitely worth a visit. "
"Beautiful views and small interesting museum"
"Free entry to the castle ruins and a minimal entry fee into the Courthouse Museum (open Weds and Sat).  The Museum is worth spending 30 minutes in and has just about the right sort of exhibits and information to capture your interest.   Of course the views are splendid from the castle over the viaduct and Bebra Gardens."
"Views to die for"
"If you've ever wondered where people go to get the amazing view of the railway viaduct crossing the River Nidd,  there are lots of angles from the Castle grounds - 80 metres or so above the river."
"Lovely day"
"Castle and views were lovely,  but as it was mid week, nothing was open! Lovely views though. Great day out,would come back again. "
"Castle"
"Beautifully maintained derelict castle in the centre of Knaresborough. The old cells remain under the courthouse. The surrounding gardens were well maintained"
"Very well kept"
"Free entry which is fantastic. The grounds are very well kept and the views overlooking the river are spectacular. Signs are dotted around telling you it’s history. Will definitely visit again when everything is fully open."
"Nice old castle and beautiful views."
"Lovely castle and stunning views. It was nice to be able to get near the castle without paying!  Very busy."
"Nice place"
"A ruined castle in the centre of town. Looked after by the council and has a bowling green inside - great re-use. Fab views over the river Nidd."
"Fantastic family new year's weekend away "
"Fantastic place to visit so pictures perfect new years walk lovely little shops to look around and plenty of of great pubs to choose from <U+0001F37B>"
"Amazing views"
"A tranquil place to visit! A lovely outlook and great history! It’s amazing that the year it was built. You should visit this but don’t end up at the worlds end pub!"
"Interesting place"
"Visited with my husband and my niece and her partner. Had a good look round and in the castle. Also walked down the steep path/steps to the water. Putting and bowls wasn’t set up so we couldn’t have a go at those. Nice staff. Definitely worth a visit if in the area. Didn’t need to pre book. Just turn up and pay ."
"Fascinating Castle Ruins"
"We visited Knaresborough Castle on Tuesday 19th October, 2021, whilst on holiday in nearby Harrogate. The Castle is located behind the High Street shopping area. There is little left of the ruins but still quite interesting. There are magnificent views from the adjacent gardens of the railway viaduct over the River Nidd. Also there is accessible river walks down the steep paths. Well worth a visit."
"Pretty ruined castle"
"Small castle ruins. Unfortunately due to covid the buildings were not open however the castle itself is fascinating and there are some great views of Knaresborough."
"Stunning views"
"We climbed the stairs from the Riverside and it was very much worth it, the views from around the castle grounds are beautiful, something so peaceful about watching people boat up and down the river."
"Beautiful views"
"Remains of the Middle Ages castle now part of a well kept garden/park with great views over the river and the railway viaduct. There is a museum in the ground unfortunately it wasn’t open during our visit. The vista over the river and weir are worth a visit alone. Plenty of parking close by and within walking distance of the town centre. Make it part of your Knaresborough visit."
"Interesting"
"Not much of the castle is ledt, but the area is worth a visit just for the view and the posters about the historyof the castle"
"Great to see"
"After going to Mother Shipton's Cave we walked up to Knaresborough Castle to have a look.  There is not much left of the castle so it doesn't take long to do but it is lovely to visit, you can go inside and a lovely lady at the entrance gave us an information sheet to read whilst looking around.  Great views also.  If you are in the area then it is definitely worth a visit,  not much is free these days so enjoy"
"Day trip"
"Went here for a stop overIt was lovely Plenty to see and doThe castle surrounds was lovely A lovely park Some view u can see from the castle The walks are amazing "
"Stunning view"
"Stunning views. Great experience and a good exercise. Would recommend visiting. Free to walk around and good history lesson"
"Great views and area to wander "
"Lovely area to walk round. Clean and tidy. Easy to get to from Town or walk up from the river. Wear sensible shoes as there are lots of steps "
"Lovely scenic walks."
"Lots to see, Museum, underground escape tunnel. Gardens, beautiful view of the viaduct. Walk down to the riverside, where there is a lovely cafe and hiring of boats for a row along the river."
"Lovely walk beautiful ruin well maintained grounds "
"Beautiful scenic ruin of castle keep, well maintained grounds and accessible lovely walk and well informed history  both of us enjoyed our visit round Knaresborough "
"Atmospheric ruin with great views"
"This is a very atmospheric ruin largely destroyed during the civil war. We did not go inside it, but because it is on a steep hill the views down to the river from the grounds are magnificent. We climbed up to it from the river without realising you can just walk on the level from the town centre! The museum in the grounds is also worth a visit."
"Stunning Views"
"This has the most stunning views and is a beautiful place to visit / just sit. You get great views of the Nidd, Knaresborough and of the viaduct. Castle was not open when we visited but those views!!!"
"Return visit"
"We came back to the castle to enjoy the terrific views from the grounds. The castle remains are quite limited, to the curtain walls, a gateway and a fairly substantial tower, that said it’s still worth a short visit and if it’s warm there are lots of seats and the lawned areas are well used for visitors to enjoy too."
"Great corner of English history"
"Knaresborough castle can be visiting in two ways: firstly, you can just walk into the ruins of the Castle (which are well maintained - more like a park) and enjoy the views as a member of the public.  There is parking nearby, and the views over the river and the viaduct are amazing.  But it would be quite a short visit.For a few extra quid you can also visit the remains of the keep itself, and the 'courthouse museum' (claims to be the oldest surviving courthouse in Britain, and it may well be).  Those are small attractions (and the entry fee reflects it), but they do a good job of capturing the main historical interest around the castle.  It is reasonably interesting for adults, but younger children (and probably teens as well) might just find it a bit boring."
"Stunning views"
"Stunning views and a beautiful place to visit. There are some lovely seating areas where you can get a coffee/tea and just sit and look at the view. You get great views of Knaresborough and of the viaduct. It was a lovely walk down to the river to see the little boats and get a coffee. There are some lovely walksIt is quite a hard walk back up the hills/steps so it’s not ideal if you are not great on your feet"
"Interesting and great views!"
"Really enjoyed the Castle.  Beautifully kept grounds, including a moving and lovely War Memorial just above the waterfall & stream below.  Spectacular views of the impressive viaduct and town."
"Fabulous views"
"Interesting history of the castle, but the main attraction is looking down from castle to River Nidd & the rail viaduct.  It's beautiful.  Walk down to the waterfront, quite a lot of steps, & walk along by the boats for hire & little cafes & ice-cream parlour.  Information boards along the walk."
"Peaceful place and great views"
"Look for ‘Castle & Museum’ signs dotted around the main shopping area and you’ll easily find the castle. The entrance is by the Police Station. It is the ruins of the castle that are free along with the grounds, which has a central bowling green. Well maintained paths and wheelchair friendly around the grounds. Information boards are located around the site. There are fabulous views of the Knaresborough Viaduct over the Rover Nidd. It’s a half hour visit  but a nice place to relax in should you so wish."
"Nice place, great views"
"Would’ve been five ‘dots’ if it had been open (like the website said it would be in Spring/Sunmer…). I love a castle, even if it is just ruins and this has got quite a bit to see and wander around. If only we could’ve done the tour to go into the tunnels…. The views are amazing, can clearly see why they popped a castle there way back when. We parked nearby, not right beside the castle, and that was good as we got to wander the town a little and really enjoyed that too."
"Not a lot to see"
"As I was parked in adjacent grounds had a look at the castle before going to the shops.Basic just a ruin with not a lot to see but gave access to some nice views over the river."
"Lovely views"
"Really high up so you get brilliant views of the viaduct and the river below. Quite steep to get back down but worth it at the top!"
"Stunning views!"
"Came here today to have a little mooch around, it was rather busy which says a lot about how popular the castle is! There’s plenty of seating dotted around, very clean and no litter dotted around. The views from the top of the castle are lovely and you can get to the castle many ways… if you are fit and mobile you can walk up some steep steps from the riverside or if that’s something you struggle with you can park at the top in the castle car park. Would definitely return."
"Fantastic views "
"We were doing a treasure trail around the town and you end up at the castle it has good parking and you get an excellent view. We came up through the gardens which can be punishing as it is very steep but that was fine for us bit the lesser Mobile will want to park at the top right by the castle remains "
"Free Entry "
"Visited Knaresborough Castle for something to do as we were in area and we had heard about the castle.The views once at the castle looking down onto the River Nidd and the Viaduct are amazing, great place for a panoramic picture.This place is steeped in history not much remains of the castle but its an ideal place for walking, scenic shots and walks along the river.Plenty of cafés along the river front too.Beware of the very steep steps going down to the river, best way is to walk all the way around down the roads."
"Great Views"
"Entry to the Castle was free. It is situated in a central location to the town and has impressive views down towards the River Nidd and the viaduct. The castle is very much a ruin but is interesting to look at and the surrounding gardens were very pleasant. Well worth an inspection when in Knaresborough."
"Great to be able to visit for free"
"It was great that entry is free. It was interesting to walk around the ruins and the views of the  river and viaduct were great."

"Small castle with spectacular views of the river"
"The castle is a brilliant location for photographs of the river and viaduct.  The castle itself is quite a small derelict building but the grounds on top of the hill give great views of the riverside and viaduct below."
"Very interesting area"
"There are Stunning views enriched with history. Get your walking shoes on and visit this wonderful area on foot.There are lots of cafes selling takeaway drinks if you don't want to eat or drink indoors.There are public toilets near to the castle, with sufficient supplies.The whole area is beautiful at this time of year, with the Autumn change of colours.The castle area has very well maintained gardens, and you can walk down to the riverside.From there you can walk past rowing boats, a church in the rock and past some amazing houses.The area is dog friendly too.There are many walks you can do, as well as some interesting independent shops and cafes in the town centre."
"Interesting"
"Just off the town centre, the ruins of the castle are perched on the cliff top above the river.  Great views !"
"Gorgeous Outlook"
"Knaresborough is a Town of two halves, that located on the banks of the River Nidd, and that sited well above the River.The Castle, or ruins thereof, holds a commanding position overlooking the Gorge through which the River flows.It has some lovely Gardens adjacent to it, which are Publicly accessible, where you may sit, rest and relax. That is especially enjoyableafter you have claimed the many steps which ascend from the River Banks down in the Gorge, up to the site of the Castle.And after recovering from your exertions, you are just yards from the centre of the Town, with it's other attractions to explore."
"Historic"
"Very historic and prominent castle ruins. Not a great deal left to see but you can blame Cromwell for that! Really well kept with magnificent views. Also refreshing to know it’s free to enter and enjoy."
"Lovely place to visit"
"Really interesting place but would advise approaching it from the town as we climbed up   the steps which were  very hard going!  However it was worth it"
"Wonderful viee"
"Entered the free area castle from the top of the town and discovered a peaceful place with a wonderful view "
"A spectacular vantage point"
"Knaresborough Castle enjoys a spectacular vantage point high above the River Nidd. The views on a clear sunny day are unbeatable."
"Cromwells crumbling legacy"
"Usual destroyed wonderful castle by Cromwell and his merry buthchers. The view of the railway  bridge over the nidd is great pleanty of places to sit and have picnics well worth a visit."
"Ravens were a delight"
"We were lucky enough to see the ravens and hear their ""owner"" talking about them.  Quite a hike up the hill to the castle but well worth the effort.  "
"nice walk to use up a couple of hours"
"Drove here from our hotel and it was pleasant walk up to the castle and under the railway bridge. Couple of hours and then a cuppa"

"Nice place to start "
"This is a nice place to start your trip to Knaresborough with fantastic views of the river and viaduct "

"We had a lovely walk down the river and climbed up to castle not entirely appropriate for mobility issues . However if you access from the car park in town then a wheelchair can be used in the castle . Lovely view . "

"Nice walk around, lovely scenery to look down on waterside , boats , cafes,ice creams, museum, market day wednesdays, mother ship tons cave , conneyham hall grounds,good places to vist, walk,nice shops, cafes in Knaresborough.plenty of pubs eating places."
"Beautiful place ruined by chained up ravens"
"A gorgeous place to visit, highly recommend it for the scenery and rowing boat hire. Downside is seeing loads of ravens chained up purely for public entertainment, how cruel? Especially on a really hot day with huge crowds of people surrounding them. Felt so sorry for those birds and I’m sure a lot of other people visiting would feel the same."
"Castle recommend"
"Lovely day with the family couldn’t access the castle but children enjoyed the castle grounds and the ravens"
"Top photo opportunity. "
"Castle offers the best view in Knaresbough and is worth the hike up from the car park. Parking limited off the High Street. "
"Evening stroll "
"A lovely place to walk, especially in the evening when it catches the sun and the whole place has a holiday feeling. Views amazing. "
"A pleasant way to spend an hour."
"We managed to park directly next to the castle entrance which is situated by the shops in the town.Beautiful views are on offer out over the River Nidd as well as the viaduct and the gardens are immaculate although I was not too keen on every rubbish bin overflowing.Nice to see the ruins and a great way to spend an hour for free too.Visited 20th July 2020"
"fun hour exploring the castle ruins"
"We spent a lovely afternoon in Knaresborough; walking along the river in the sunshine, visiting Mother Shipton's Cave and also exploring the castle ruins. There are beautiful views over the River Nidd and of the Viaduct from Knaresborough Castle Grounds.You are able to wander around the grounds and enjoy the ruins for free, although I understand you can also tour inside at a cost. A little exposed on the hill top so best visited when the weather is nice."
"While in town "
"Having visited Mother Shipton Cave we could see the castle from the other side so we wandered to the other side of the river and found our way here. Lovely views from the top down over the gorge. Helpful information signs dotted around the site. "
"Lovely old castle with amazing views."
"Very peaceful area with lovely walking areas. The Castle itself is very interesting and makes you wonder who would have lived there and how magnificent it would have been. At certain times they have picnics in the grounds and other functions. The views are a sight to behold, stunning views of the river and forestry and makes the perfect picture if you like photography and scenery. Would definitely recommend a visit to this Castle. A walk round the town would add to your experience as it is quaint, lovely shops and a pleasure to walk round."
"Great place to visit"
"I live quite nearby and, whenever I have visitors staying, I always make sure to bring them to Knaresborough, which is a very historic and interesting town, with some fabulous views at and from the castle."
"Great View"
"This is a love place to sit and reflect and to take in the beautiful surroundings. The ruins of the castle are great to see with plenty of information around for those who wish to find out more. "
"Fantastic views ..."
"Perched on the best vantage point in town, the river and viaduct views are magnificent. There are lots of information boards dotted around the site giving fascinating facts about the castle's history. Paths are good for walking the whole site, which is free to access.Well worth a visit if you’re in the area."
"Excellent "
"Take a wander around the castle and enjoy the views. You can pay to take a little tour inside which is great but also a wander on the outside still provides lots to see. "
"Leg stretch"
"Having been in the car for a while we stopped off for a leg stretch.The castle grounds were lovely and well kept. The view from the top was lovely and gave a good view of the viaduct."
"The grounds are nice"
"The grounds are nice and provide excellent views of the River Nidd and surrounding cottages in the gorge"
"Historic"
"Central to the town centre. Just a ruin, but still worth visiting and exploring.An added bonus of fantastic viewsCertainly one for history seekers"
"Amazing views"
"As always it is a pleasure to see the beautiful grounds that knaresborough takes great pride over. We often take a walk around on the dark evenings to see the castle & viaduct lite up. "
"Interesting"
"A well kept site with a impressive war memorial, The castle sadly is one that Cromwell knocked about a bit , or should that be a lot. But there are information boards showing how it would have looked. There are stunning views up the river Nidd and viaduct.Also good views of town."
"Imprwssive"
"Impressive ruins and outstanding scenery with great views of the viaduct. It’s very pretty and totally worth the trip. "
"This is a lovely old town with many loveley viewa and walks"
"You can spend the day wandering around this town seeing all the loveley views and places of interest,for all the family, and dine in one of the many places to eat"
"High vantage spot"
"Knaresborough Castle has a splendid high viewpoint over the River Nidd. A lovely sunny January morning enhanced the view."
"The Castle and views make it worthwhile"
"We visited the site and depending on the time of year, this being December, makes you wonder what the previous inhabitants thought of the view, the surroundings.On a cool day you want to be round a large real fire as they probably did.However, you have to appreciate the magnificient view down to the river, the viaduct, and the feeling of being Lord and Master looking at your domain.Its a wonderful historic site and still captivates you whenever we visit."
"Lovely old ruin with views of the river below "
"We visited yesterday I must admit the weather was very poor cold and misty the castle ruins looked quite mysterious and sinister the views we’d hoped for where somewhat poor we will definitely come back another day "
"Beautiful"
"Worth walking in the rain to the top of Knaresborough to see not only the castle ruins but the incredible views. Despite the weather it was still popular"
"Day at knaresborough "
"A last minute day out with my partner , parked in the long stay car park and walked through town up to the castle. Nice walk great views from top of the castle over the river and town. Had lunch in a cafe at the side of the river. Probably be a better day if the weather was better."
"Great views "
"The views from this area are fantastic and would afford some excellent photographs.  You can park in the town and access it this way very easily, or you can walk by the river and walk up the very steep paths and steps to it. It's a ruin and the actual castle won't keep you amused for very long. Sometimes the ravens are there and this can be very engaging for children. Its main draw is its outstanding setting and magnificent views."
"Lovely views"
"Walked along river and up the steps to the castle. Not a bad hike. Not sure the £7 we paid to look round castle and museum was worth it. "
"Castle ruins with excellent views"
"Worth the steep climb from the Riverside Walk, or the short stroll from the town centre. Castle ruins with spectacular views, well worth a visit."
"Location, location, location"
"A ruin but what a view of the viaduct, and free to boot. Take a walk down to what was the moat through Bebra gardens."
"Riverside walk, bebra gardens +castle"
"A lovely walk by the river, up through the gardens and to the castle to introduce visitors to our picturesque town."
"Beautiful"
"While wondering around we stumbled upon the castle ruins. It's only£3.50 for entry into what's left of the castle and museum. The grounds are immaculately kept and the views overlooking the river are stunning"
"Beautiful views."
"Although the actual castle ruin was nothing special, the views from it were. The town itself is quaint with lots of equally beautiful views. Well worth a visit."
"Great historic place!"
"Great old ruined castle to visit.  We had a tour of the castle, grounds and secret passageway, which was really interesting and informative.  There is also a small museum which is also informative and very fascinating.  Great place with great views!  Very cheap as well!"
"Historic castle with Great Views"
"Although the castle itself is well worth seeing - it is substantially a ruin. The view down to the River Nidd and the Railway Viaduct is just inspirational."
"Lovely ruins"
"The castle itself was closed off when we visit but still the walk around the outside was lovely. The place is so clean and the grounds well maintained."
"Great place to visit in good weather "
"I've been to knavesborough a few times. I went on the train from York a 30 minutes ride away. It is very hill so be prepared to a lot of walking up hill. I went to the castle. To get there they is some steep steps but once at thd top its worth it. Great views of the bridge and the river. You can go into the castle its self at a small charge. I didn't go in but enjoyed the gardens and lovely views. The walk down can be nice and steady. They is a paddling pool we're on a nice day kids seem to be enjoying. A nice walk along the river. Plus a nice sit along the riverside. I was going to go to mother Shipton cave but its £10 per adult. I've been before so I didn't think it's worth going for the cost. Although if you have never been I would recommend going "
"Amazing view and grounds"
"Amazing view of the train viaduc, landmark for knaresboro, harrogate by extension, and even England! Dont miss the middle age lady with her crows on the grounds, like from mid morning. On wednesday, stroll the open air market and listen to the town crier on market place 11am like"
"Decent spot to have a wander"
"Really pleasant day in Knaresborough - some great views from the castle and a nice place to have an explore. Not been before but had a decent day."
"Great place to walk dogs/picnic/scooter"
"We love spending lazy sundays here as a family!  We often have a game of mini golf too! Ravens are there on a weekend. "
"Good displays of interesting history of the town and its inhabitants"
"Castle ruins and grounds housing the Kings Tower and the museum/ courthouse, modest entrance fee. Modern interesting display about the castle and the town’s ups and downs through its long history ; Tudor times, the Civil war, the Gunpowder Plot etc "
"picturesque"
"very pleasant place to walk around lots of history ,good paths and very nice view as well as well kept gardens"
"Castle on the hill"
"Knaresborough can be divided into two parts: there’s the flatter part by the river, and then the town at the top of the hill. Rising above both are the ruins of Knaresborough Castle.The castle ruins are reached by climbing the hill that separates the town and riverside. The hill is very steep, with winding stepped-paths cut into it. The views from the top of the town and surrounding countryside are spectacular, and well worth the climb.There’s been a fortress, or a royal castle, on this site since the eleventh century, but all you can see now is what remains from after the castle was destroyed in the Civil War. The remains are impressive though, and include towers, battlements and gateways, which give you an idea of the scale of the castle, and how imposing it must have looked perched high on the hill. You can pay and go inside what’s left of the structure, but we didn’t as you can see a large part of it from the surrounding grounds. The grounds themselves include floral displays, a war memorial, a bowling green and, on certain days, you can get up close and personal with the castle’s ravens. Perhaps the best thing though is the view from the battlements of the countryside below. It’s hard to drag your eyes away."
"HIDDE GEM"
"Me and my wife staying at a nearby campsite, we walked into Knaresborough and I am glad we did, We walked and had a look around the Castle ruins and immaculate kept gardens, the view down over the river was stunning, beautiful little town and we are all ready planning another visit."
"Excellent & outstanding "
"Wow this little town and in particular the Castle and surrounding river, viaduct and pretty little cafes is a must to visit. The weather on our visit was appalling (rained all day) but we still enjoyed our visit and will be going back. "
"Worth a Visit!"
"Unfortunately the day we visited we experienced very heavy rain but this did not spoil our visit.   Set in lovely grounds, wander at your leisure taking in the views over the River Nidd. As is the case with lots of castles it is a ruin and some areas are cordoned off so do take care.    Well worth a visit (even on a wet day)!"
"Not much left but Stunning views"
"Not much left of the Castle its mostly ruined apart from the Keep and sally port tunnel but relaxing setting with some of the best views in whole of the U.k looking over the river Nidd."
"Nice visit "
"Visited with young children, 1 pram. Was fine walking round the castle with pram but if u plan on going down into the gardens below and on to the river there’s lots of steps. Castle was worth a visit but quite small. Lovely views and parking was £1,60 for 4 hours "
"Well-kept and great views"
"We hadn't intended to visit the castle. Didn't even know that one existed. However. Delightful, well-kept. Informative. Steps down and around at certain points but easy access around the castle property. The view of the viaduct from the castle is supreme. Free entry."
"Great place to visit"
"The castle is at the top of the hill but it is a lovely walk to the top and the views from the castle are spectacular. For those not able to walk you are able to drive up to the castle. Check out the castle's rooks while you tour the grounds"
"Worth a look"
"A lot of steps up but worth it when you get up there the views are amazing from up there the whole place is full of history for this small town"
"Great views. "
"Time place to take some time out. Great views of the river. Worthwhile to visit if in area. However not for a full day. "
"Off of the beaten path"
"I did not find this castle in any tourist book or info, but on a picture someone posted on Pinterest! Since it was so near a main highway we stopped and I am so glad we did. We were the only ones there and we walked about the ruins of this castle. It was easy to get to as we parked our car in the charming little town square nearby. From the Castle you have a very good view of the river and the Knaresborough Viaduct."
"Interesting museum with lovely view"
"A well laid out and interesting museum though small it tells the civil war history of the area it also houses an original oak Court room from the 12century  great castle ruin to explore too well worth a visit."
"Free garden with castle ruins and lovely view"
"If you’re wandering around Knaresborough on a warm evening, pop into the castle gardens, sit on the benches and suck up the views of the river..."
"CASTLE VIEWS"
"We visited the castle ruins and read the information board. It is surprising that so much remains after all this time. The view was fantastic as it is perched on top of a ""cliff edge""  don't worry about falling off as there are a couple of terraces where you can sit and enjoy the views. Spotted a train crossing the bridge spanning the valley."
"Really informative visit and I recommended the tour"
"Great value for money only £3.50 the tour guide gives great facts about life and the grounds which the castle once covered before the majority of it was destroyed during the civil war of 1648 thanks to a successful petition to parliament at that time the rest of the demolition was halted."
"Castle with stunning views"
"we visited the castle on a day trip to Knaresborough. situated in beautiful grounds overlooking the stunning river Nidd with its fabulous bridge, The castle is old ruins now but still well worth a look. and see the castle ravens sitting on the walls watching your every move. loads of seats and grassy areas to sit and watch the world go by."
"Charming Gem"
"Knaresborough Castle , and the park around the Castle Yard is a delightful place to spend a couple of realaxing hours. Beautiful views over the Nidd , lovely sunny and shady spots with a putting green and brilliantly kept grounds. Then theres the chance to visit the museum and castle remains."
"Day out"
"Very interesting ,very relaxing lovely views of the river Nidd ,payed my respects at the war memorial there which had beautifuly polished brass plates with the names of the fallen soldiers."
"Lovely place"
"There isn't much at the castle but the grounds are nice and we will visit again soon and go in the museum.  Walk down the steps to the river and you are in a different place altogether; absolutely stunning Riverside, views and the viaduct is such an impressive piece of engineering - almost worth a trip just to see that! Hire a row.boat and paddle about on the river in the sun in the shadow of the castle and you could be anywhere, such a lovely place to escape modern life!  Highly recommended."
"Best if you approach the castle from the town, not the river."
"The castle ruins are on a high cliff overlooking the gorge of the River Nidd. It is a very steep climb up to it from the river so better by far to get a bus to the market place in the centre of the town and walk from there. The castle was mostly destroyed after the English Civil War but one tower was spared at the request of the inhabitants who wanted somewhere for a prison. This tower and the old courthouse are open to the public. Putting and bowls can be played within the remains of the walls. Great views over the river. The only toilets are public ones outside the entrance."
"Amazing gardens and veiws"
"One of the nicest gardens I have sat in, beautiful plants and trees, very well tended. An excellent war memorial in the far part of the gardens. A wonderful view of the river Nidd and the famous iconic railway bridge of Knaresborough. This place is well worth a visit."
"Unmissable "
"Spectacular views from the castle grounds of the River Nidd and the Railway Viaduct. The £3.50 admission ticket is real value for money. "
"Scenic"
"First time ever to Knaresborough castle. We walked around the grounds. Very well kept. Plenty of places to sit down. "
"Ruins quite picturesque "
"We didn’t go into the museum but happy to spend a little while walking around the ruins in its picturesque locale.The castle car park was well located to access the ruins as well as Knaresborough town and only £1 for 2 hours (up to 4 available)"
"Lovely place"
"Lovely place to visit with family, helpful people with tours of the place. Museum has some nice things that explain the history of the area. Views from the castle are beautiful. Well kept dog friendly as long as you keep them on leads and clean up after."
"Great views from Castle Hill"
"The views from Castle Hill were just so lovely. It was an easy walk from the car park and the views and outlook were lovely. The walk down to the waterside might have been doable if I wasn’t so lazy about doing stairs...if you are fit it looked well work the walk. A lovely little town and work visiting."
"Knaresborough Bed Race"
"Amazing place to visit on the day of the knaresborough Bed Race and to be able to see all the entrants taking part"
"Great views!"
"We visited whilst on a day trip to Knaresborough. The castle ruins are interesting to see, especially the dungeon with pigeons nesting! The museum has lots of information about the castle and it’s history and is well worth a look.Great views over the town and the opportunity to play bowls or pitch and putt for a small fee. Well worth a visit. "
"Lovely spot for a stroll- oh yes, the views are stunning also"
"Have been to Knaresborough a  few times and seen the amazing viaduct, but somehow missed a trip to the castle.tucked behind the market place shops are the well kept castle grounds, with resident ravens, loads of beautiful ""serpent"" legged benches to rest on.The views of the town, and particularly the railway viaduct are fabulous.Can walk down to the river from here, one for the next visit."
"Fascinated by the Resident Ravens"
"Been before but it was literally a quick pre shopping visit, the ravens and their story about them was amazing...who knew they were songbirds and could talk."
"Fantastic views"
"To wander around the grounds is free. Lovely picnic spot There is a small fee to enter the tower, tunnels and museum but it is worth it, particularly the museum which whilst small is very informative "
"Lovely walk"
"Dont visit Knaresbourgh without a visit. Really pleasant with great views.  Great for couples and families "
"Delightful visit"
"The glorious weather helped, but this a wonderful place to visit. Interesting museum and the price of that ticket includes the castle. At £2.50 for concessions it is excellent value. The view from the castle of the viaduct bridge was lovely and much photographed by everyone. We were lucky that the time of our visit coincided with a guided tour of the Sallyport, a secret tunnel."
"Restful and well kempt"
"The ideal spot for a relaxing stroll in summer sunshine. Beautifully maintained grounds, historic buildings and superb views"
"Stunning view"
"We visited more for the amazing view down to the river and the viaduct which really is to be recommended.  It was just starting to rain which got steadily worse so didn't spend as long as we would have wished wandering or drinking it it.  But definitely worth a stop for the view alone."
"The views."
"Beautiful views of Knaresborough from here. Simply stunning. Took the mother in law for a visit and we did the tour underground. She thoroughly enjoyed learning about the history of it."
"Amazing views"
"Absolutely stunning views over the viaduct and gorge from the castle gardens,walked down through the gardens to the riverside where there were plenty of cafes to grab a bite and a drink"
"Good view along the river bridge and lovely garden"
"We visited to the castle on May bank holiday. This has got very good view along the river.Garden is also very nice. The museum is not worth so instead of wasting time you can enjoy bowling garden.Kids really enjoyed it."
"Beautiful views along the river gorge"
"Well worth a visit - putting green for a bit of fun. Pay to enter the museum and you can also have a look around the castle keep."
"A day trip"
"Just a lovely little place to see. Not an expensive entry fee at the museum as the ticket also let you gain entry to the castle afterwards. Worth a look"
"Lovely gardens, worth a visit"
"We visited from the top entrance through the gardens. The gardens are lovely and well kept, the castle is basically just a ruin. Worth a visit when in the area, the gardens look down onto the river, a nice chilled out space to relax."
"The ravens are chained up and raggedy"
"One was walking around limping and trying to hide. The others were just chained to a wall in the baking heat. No idea why anyone would want to keep a bird this way, it’s just cruel and old fashioned."
"Well sited structure"
"While the castle os now largely a ruin it is very well sited on a prominent position above the River Nidd and no doubt in past times was a strong defensive structure. Well worth visiting for 20-30 minutes to get a good look over the surrounding countryside."
"Medieval graffiti and secret tunnel"
"This is a small castle.  Loved the secret tunnel.  The museum was very small but interesting.  Worth a visit"
"Well worth the climb - cute little castle"
"the best part of the castle for me (as we didnt pay to go in the museum) was the spectacular views of the river and aquaduct. there is a putting and bowling green which looked loads of fun and the kids really enjoyed it."
"lovely from outside but not worth paying to go in"
"from the castle area you get great views over knaresborough and the viaduct. castle istelf is quite picturesque from the outside. we made the mistake of paying to get in to see all of 2 empty rooms (not worth it). go and have a look from outside and walk around grounds, maybe have a game of bowls or putting but dont go in, carry on down the river for a nice walk of go down the steps to the cafes at the waterside."
"Great views..."
"Beautifully kept grounds and a wonderful setting.Great panoramic views across Knaresborough and the surrounds.Worth the effort to walk up to this landmark if you visit."
"Ruins on the hill"
"We climbed the steps to visit the castle and enjoyed walking round - there are beautiful views of Knaresborough from here. The Ravens were out.  Don't like seeing them tied up, but understand why they are."
"Beautiful "
"It is a little bit of a trek with the steps leading up, but if you are in good health and fit it’s not anything to be worried about. Once at the top the views are great, the colourful flowers are in bloom, and it’s a perfect viewpoint. "
"Beautiful view from lovely ruins set in wonderful gardens"
"Wow, this castle was well worth a visit, set just by the centre of this small town, on top of the hill overlooking the river.  What a stunning view it was of the river and the old railway viaduct!  The ruins are lovely, with good explanations of the remains.  There are wonderful gardens within the castle walls, including a bowling green.  Just below the castle, there are more gardens and from there you can walk down to stroll along the river bank."
"Beautiful views"
"Visited one of our favourite places for a Mother's day treat and it never fails to deliver. The views are beautiful and worth the steep walk to get to the top. Sitting in the sun watching the world go by is relaxing and joyous."
"Fascinating place with great views"
"My wife and I visited Knaresborough during our 3 day visit to Harrogate. Knaresborough is a fascinating village on two levels full of history. The castle ruins still have much to look at and from the grounds you have a fantastic view of the viaduct. Well worth a look."
"Knaresborough castle"
"Little to see except the ruins but a great view over the river Nidd and overlooking the old town .  The courthouse museum was not open when we visited."
"Impressive Bulk and Position with Great Views"
"Climbed up the steps from the riverside walk and you get a good impression of its importance and influence on the town. It's bulk is impressive and quite a bit survives considering how close it is to the town. Excellent views and several interpretation boards telling the complex history."
"Nice that it is free for all. "
"Never been to Knaresborough before and it was a delight. There is not much left of the castle but it is respectfully maintained and kept safe. The grounds have been lovingly cared for and it is free. There are signs explaining the area and the views are stunning."
"Lovely spot with spring blooms"
"Did a walk here on a Sunday afternoon. It was a beautiful place with lots of blooms and gorgeous views. Really enjoyed it.Recommended "
"Free to enter excellent views"
"Pleasantly surprised by this place. Destroyed in the English civil war. The ruins are kept in immaculate condition as are the gardens. Fantastic views over the river and railway bridge. Recommend for a relaxing stroll and maybe picnic. And it’s free!! Recommend "
"Always a pleasure to visit"
"We visit Knaresborough every few years and always visit the Castle. It is always kept so clean and has the perfect vantage spot to see the viaduct and the river. A must see place."
"Good views"
"Although the castle isn't open in winter there is still a lovely park and fantastic views. Nice walks along the river if the weather is good. Easy parking in town. Lots of information boards about the history."
"Enjoyable "
"Came upon the castle unexpectedly off the High Street, a quiet oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the town.  Plenty of informative plaques telling the history of the castle and great views of the river and viaduct "
"Excellent when tours are on,.otherwise nice views but not much there"
"If you want to spend a decent amount of time here and gain some knowledge then check when they are doing the guided tours. The volunteer guides are excellent and ours took us down into the dungeons and other areas not open all the time.If you don't catch a tour though, you can walk around in about 10 minutes. The views over the river are amazing from the castle's position high over it. Be aware it's not especially wheelchair/pushchair friendly and there's no easy access from the castle to the riverside apart from steep steps."
"Castle ruin with interesting history and wonderful views"
"Only the castle ruins left but interesting and with a fantastic view over the River Nidd. It was originally a Norman castle."
"A good climb"
"There is only a little of the original castle remaining.  Walking towards the viaduct it is a good clambour up the steps, but worth it for the view.  There is no charge for entry."
"A ruin with commanding views of the river Nidd"
"This has been a substantial structure, now largely in ruins. Occupying a strategic vantage point over the river since the 1100s, the castle suffered during the civil war and some of the scars are still visible today. Parliament ordered the castle -which had been in royalist hands- to be 'spoiled' (made unusable) in 1646. During the summer months, visitors may explore the sally ports and the King's Tower but my wife and I were still impressed when we visted on Sunday last."
"Interesting place with good views"
"The castle area itself is quite short on standing structures, but rich in both history, layout of surrounding gardens, walkways and views. Can't wait to visit again in the summer!!!!"
"A market day treat"
"I visited on the day of the local market, although small, still an enjoyable amount to see. If you are lucky the corvid keeper might be there! "
"Castle"
"Lovely place and plenty of information boards Parking might be a problem on market days We went in October  but spring is a better time with flower out"
"Not a lot of castle left to see."
"Built on a strategic hill there are good views over the gorge and River Nidd. It is free to walk around which is not surprising as there is not a lot to see."
"Lovely views over the river and town"
"Ruins were open but rest was closed, so watch out for opening times. Can also be difficult to park. Town itself is worth a wander, though not very big some pretty traditional lanes"
"Traveler "
"Amazing, historic, beautiful views, and lovely landscape.  The view from below the castle ruins looking towards the river with a view of the large bridge is breathtaking.  A must see walk about in knarsborough. "
"Atmospheric"
"Lovely place to visit to update your knowledge on this castle ruin. Lovely surroundings overlooking the River Nidd. Definitely worth a visit"
"Vist Knaresborough Castle"
"If going to north Yorkshire, this lovely little town is well worth a visit. It has plenty of shops to look around, a lovely market square and an impressive castle that overlooks the castle. If you visit the castle you can get some fantastic pictures of the viaduct below and the town. Well worth a visit."
"Lovely at night"
"Just had a lovely romantic walk around the castle with it beautifully lit up. Then walked down the steps to the river which could do with being lit up too"
"Great views over the river and viaduct"
"It's more that chunks of castle remain here and the but the castle yard is well cared-for and a pleasant place to walk.  Super views down to the river.  Our visit was on a crisp, súnny December day - most enjoyable."
"Still gets the imagination going and very well kept"
"We had this all to ourselves having gone in December. Still, clear and crisp winters day, it was very atmospheric and the views were breathtaking. That iconic viaduct bridge and the river flowing underneath. Knaresborough is a very lovely town"
"Amazing views"
"Visited last month.  Amazing views from the castle of Knaresborough, river, viaduct.  We had a lovely walk round the castle grounds and followed path that took us to some gardens/pool below.  Would recommend."
"Tranquil setting"
"Albeit our visit to Knaresborough was brief, it was a lovely brisk walk to the edge of the castle which enhanced our visit to this lovely little town. The view from the castle over the river and surrounding area was well worth a walk. It’s peaceful and enchanting."
"Smashing day!"
"Spent the day in Knaresbrough and the highlight was definitely visiting the castle and meeting her majesty's keeper of the castle Ravens. We were allowed to put on a gauntlet and hold one of them. The castle is mainly ruins but it's interesting and peaceful with fabulous views "
"Beautiful views from the castle "
"Lovely visit. Free to roam around the site. Beautiful location and scenery. Information boards placed around the site and memorial for veterans on site."
"Photo opportunity "
"Parked our car right next to the castle without realising. We just had to look around before we got back in the car.  So pleased we did. Was a cold day but had a walk around. The views were stunning. Couldn’t stop taking photos. Well worth a visit . "
"needs some love"
"the whole area is in need of some investment,perhaps a computerised 3D images of what the castle and suroundings would have looked like in its haydays."
"Kids loved it here"
"Had a lovely time, looked round the castle, did some colouring and rubbings in the old police station/prison.  Went down the secret route out of the castle - what a brilliant experience"
"Prominent views"
"WE stumbled across the remains of this Norman castle as we tried to navigate our way down to river level to see the viaduct.What is left is displayed in pleasant garden settings from which it is possible to get great views down to the river and the viaduct.There are also various benches to sit and take in the ruins while information boards tell the visitor what they are looking at.Walkways allow visitors to stroll round the whole castle ruin area or enjoy views over a wide area and the gardens can be accessed both from the town or from the river below up steep steps which are not for the disabled.Well worth a visit for anyone exploring Knaresborough."
"Lovely views "
"Castle £3.50 entry and the museum £3.50 entry.  The resident ravens looked a bit vicious to me although they say they’re tame.  The views of the river from here are stunning.  Lots of steps back to the river "
"Worth a visit"
"Not much remains of the castle but it does afford wonderful views of the bridge and river and unusually has two resident ravens who are happy to pose for photographs.    It makes for good strolling if you are in Knaresborough."
"Outstanding "
"This is a must see when you visit.You get stunning views over the river. The famous one being up river looking at the rail bridge.Great location."
"Fantastic views"
"The ruins of this castle are quite impressive and the grounds are a public park but as the castle is situated on top of a high cliff and the stunning and dramatic view of the River Nidd and the viaduct crossing it is breathtaking. "
"What a view! "
"Lovely ruins in well kept grounds. The view down to the river and bridge is breathtaking. Plenty of benches to sit and enjoy the view. "
"Castle? Really?!"
"Calling the place a Castle is a bit misleading in my opinion, as new visitors might expect much more. Should the place been considered a public park it would have definitely got a higher stars from me as the views from the place is amazing specially the bridge across the river."
"Beautiful views"
"We were lucky to have clear blue skies and the views from the castle are stunning. Plaques around giving information, museum and tunnel were closed though as september"
"Affords good views of the river and viaduct"
"The castle ruins were good to see and get the imagination going as to the site in its former glory. The views from up by the castle also make it totally worthwhile for a visit."
"Great history and position"
"Whilst the castle is in ruins and the museum was not open, this is a lovely spot.  Perched high with great views of the river and town beneath.  The castle ravens are really tame and fun and the new flower bed commemorating 50 years of the steam train is pretty."
"Nice grounds, great view of the river and viaduct"
"We didn't go into the castle museum, but the grounds and ruins are interesting and very pleasant to sit awhile. The view of the river and the railway viaduct is an absolute classic. Plenty of trains, only diesel units though. Note for some of us over a certain age though......there's a lot of steps down to that river. Like... a lot."
"Historical monument"
"This is perfect if you’re a tourist, as it’s very catering. The price to get into the castle is £5 and you can have a look at the history. "
"Very interesting"
"Enjoyed our walk around the castle and found the information plaques answered all our questions.We sat and looked at the view which is stunning from the castle."
"Not open today!"
"Great views from the castle gardens. Ravens there too on a regular basis. The castle was closed today Saturday 22 Sept 2018, not sure why but lost loads of custom. Very busy in this area a with tourists that had specifically come to see the castle. Great views of the river and plenty of seating and gardens."
"Great for the view and free"
"There’s not a lot left of the castle but it’s a peaceful space with great views across to the viaduct and the river. "
"lovely place to go"
"knaresborough very nice place to visit we have been more than once as you can have a nice walk around they is some nice shops and cafes you can visit not a big place but nice to visit "
"Stunning view from the castle grounds!"
"We had attended a family wedding in nearby Harrogate and had a few hours to kill before our flight home. I had Googled places in the area and Knaresborough looked interesting, particularly the amazing view of the river and viaduct from the castle grounds. Being into photography I wanted to capture the iconic view for myself !The ruins of the castle and the park were also interesting, especially the 'tame' ravens sitting on the back of one of the park benches!The town was pretty and quaint and we found a nice cafe for some lunch before heading off to the airport.All in all, a pleasant couple of hours spent here."
"Interesting little gem "
"Although the castle is small and mostly in ruin, it’s really interesting to see the interior and learn the history of the site. The castle grounds are free to walk around and are a lovely spot to sit down and relax. Your cheap(!) ticket includes access to the museum across the bowls green, which is also fascinating to have a look around. It’s a lovely place to visit. There was even ravens in the grounds which you can hold if you want to! A really great day out. "
"So much history"
"First visit and what an absolutely amazing wonderful historic place to visit.Parking was so cheap to. £1.60 for 24 hours.Walked around the cobbled streets and around the castle down to the river and then along to the Nid Gorge. Everywhere there was so much history to absorb.Will be going again and hopefully visit Mother Shipton Cave."
"Day our"
"Visited here.What a good place to visit for family or couples.Plenty to see and visit.Need good weather days.Rain would spoil as it is an outside place to visit"
"I love it here"
"Beautiful views . Nice place to relaxes and chill out . Even play bowls that is great fun if anyone wants try go speak to Neil on a Tuesday great guy get u playing . I enjoy getting ice-cream having a walk around .if your in area have a look round great history "
"Castle with fantastic views"
"Despite the rain (when we were there), it is worth walking around the castle and reading the information boards on its history and seeing the amazing views. Beautifully kept too."
"Place of Interest"
"A wonderful place . with great views of the River . cafes and ice-cream parlour.A fun place for every one"
"The castle with the view."
"Sitting in the grounds of this ancient castle , we follow the train as it crosses that well known Knaresborough viaduct. It’s almost stepping back in time. The pretty buildings perched all along on one side, at various levels, look like toy houses from a fairytale. The castle is full of mystery with a fascinating past. Well worth a visit."
"Excellent walk in any weather"
"The main area is on one level offering a gentle stroll for those less mobile. For the more active you can use the steps (steep) or the slopes to access Bebra Gardens, where you will find the paddling pool or head further down to the riverside where there are some interesting shops and ice cream - yeah! In the castle grounds there is generally a lady showing off the ravens - have a picture taken."
"Worth the climb - just for the views"
"My rating is for the outside and views.Only visited outside. The views were fantastic. Bonus was the lady with crows. "
"Interesting and Informative"
"Knaresborough Castle and the nearby Courthouse museum arevwell worth a visit. Modest proices £3.50 or £10 family ticket sllows you to see the history of Knaresborough and its more interesting citizens, such as Guy Fawkes, Mother Shipton and Blind Jack. The castle is modest but interesting and the tour of its escape tunnel is well conducted. The views are lovely,  and you may see the lady with her talking raven. Well worth doing if you are wondering why there are windows in town that have been turned into wall art."
"Great Views"
"Castle is set in beautiful grounds, high above the River Nidd with views towards the famous bridge scene. "
"Nice views from the top"
"When you come from Wales you know all about castles. As castles go, this is not Premier League. Maybe Conference. It a very steep climb to get there but when you make it you do get a lovely view. And the consolation that your heart must be in pretty good shape. Assuming you're still breathing, of course!"
"Grounds are lovely (and free!), castle is not worth going to more than once. "
"I was quite disappointed by our recent trip to the castle. We had hoped to spend quite a bit of time here but there is so little left to see (inside the castle) that we were in and out within 20 minutes. If you have limited mobility/very young children the steps up once you are inside the castle are very steep. I know they are castle ruins but I was surprised to see how unkept it was too. There were weeds everywhere. The grounds to the castle offer an amazing view and it is worth going up there just for that. However these can be explored without paying to enter the castle. "
"Average but amazing views"
"Location of the castle is beautiful. Knaresborough is beautiful itself and the views are stunning. The castle itself is mostly a ruin and the museum is a few rooms which is a little disappointing. There is no interaction between staff and visitors, in fact the only staff I saw was one on each till who were perfectly pleasant but just doing their job of taking your money and saying thank you basically. There is very little for children to do in comparison to other castles we have been to. There was, however, a show on outside with a guy who’s name I have forgotten (the great *someone) Basically he did tricks with fire and the children loved him. His terrible jokes were amusing for being so terrible and he was a good sport and good at dealing with a delight of a child who was essentially heckling him unsuccessfully. But he was part of the fever festival going on in knaresborough. I think more could be made of the castle and museum themselves and a bigger focus on children and children’s understanding to encourage their curiosity of history. Views and location amazing but attraction a bit naff."
"BEAUTIFUL"
"lovely walks, loads of history to the castle, daily hours tours done by very efficient guides a must for people who enjoy history "
"Spectacular views."
"We keep returning to this historic castle. The views are spectacular. At weekends you can meet the raven lady and her amazing ravens. The castle is open to visitors as is the old courthouse. This is simply a beautiful place in a wonderful special wee town."
"Great views."
"Castle is a ruin but has a commanding view overlooking the river Nidd so even if you don't bother going into the building itself it's still worth visiting the grounds in which it stands for the magnificent viewpoint. The grounds are free but there is a fee for the castle."
"Guided tour - very interesting"
"The castle is a ruin, guided tours are done regularly giving the history of the castle, and they are very good. The guided tour includes a visit to the sallyport where knights were able to sneak in and out when the castle was under siege. The views from the castle grounds over the river and viaduct are beautiful - it’s free to wander round and well worth a visit. Knaresborough is lovely, with walks and boats along the river and a little market place, nice shops and plenty of decent cafes. A great day out."
"a day out"
"we travelled to this area after viewing a program about the area. have to say was not disappointed. lovely views over the river and the castle its self had lovely views. we parked down by the river and spent nearly four hours looking round this lovely town"
"Boring "
"Knaresborough is a lovely place to visit to take lots of nice pictures I paid to go in the castle and I was shocked they even charge although it was £5.50 I literally felt robbed and then they took you in a cave it was so boring don’t waste your time even if it was free, they then let others in without paying "
"Informative and Fun"
"A lovely Visit with enough to keep the kids occupied without them getting bored with too much to read/see - fun in the stocks and interesting things for them to find. The walk down to the river was not too much of a strain either.Tip for car parking if you are going at the weekend you can park on the private parking by the dentist - the sign says so but no-one must have read it as no-one parked there and it was full still need a ticket though.."
"Picnic and views"
"Not much remains but an interesting place to visit with spectacular views over the River Nidd . This can be combined with a visit to Bebra gardens which is adjacent"
"Beautiful "
"We stayed 5 mins from the castle and were able to enjoy a walk around at different times of the day, including a band that played on a sunny afternoon. Walk down the steps to the riverside and feel you have exercised on the way up.Lovely war memorial that is beautifully kept, grounds are tidy and obviously great pride is taken.Lovely for some peace, picnic or a stroll "
"Good for a couple of hours and great view"
"I emailed the Castle in advance to see if they did tours and was informed of the times so I made sure I turned up for the 2.00pm one.   I thought the tour was going to be a guide around the ruins and last for about half an hour.   Although, it was just a tour down the Sally Gate.   The guide just said ask me if you have any questions, opened the gate and we went down the tunnel.   When we got down she showed us the route back to the Castle or the Gardens.   She said we could go back up the tunnel and it took us just 5 minutes to do it and that was the tour.    Although, it only cost £3.50 and in addition you get to go into the Castle part that is still standing and also down to the dungeon and up the stairs and there is some history on the ground floor.   The lady on the desk also gave me an information sheet which was helpful so I could read about it.   This also gets you into the museum as well which was informative so for £3.50 I can't complain and I am pleased I did it.   I also purchased a guide of the castle for £2.00 which has all the information in as well.   The grounds are beautiful and views are amazing.   Well worth a visit."
"Fabulous view"
"Unfortunately the castle was closed when we visited, but we did spend some time wandering around the grounds and had our photos taken with the castle ravens. It was a glorious afternoon, families were there with picnics, and there was a brass band performing in the grounds which gave it a wonderful atmosphere.As we did not go inside I cannot comment on what there is to see, or do."
"Well maintained grounds"
"A small and interesting place to visit with a good view of the river. It is still in the Duchy of Lancaster another castle belonging to the queen."
"Weekend in North Yorkshire"
"A relic of a bygone age! although a ruin the stunning views are worth going to see on their own. Unfortunately the castle was shut for lunch when I visited ."
"Great value visit"
"This has to be one of the best value castle visits in Yorkshire. The cost for two came to £6.00 this included the Old Courthouse, the Keep and a guided tour of the Sallyport.Compared to £12 each at two nearby Castles this was excellent value."
"Lovely place to spend the day"
"I have to disagree with previous reviewers who said there isn't enough for a full day here. We were here for 3 hours but wish we'd had more time to stay. Granted, it doesn't take long to explore the castle but the grounds are lovely, amazing views, gardens and river walks.  Next time we'll take a picnic, hire a rowing boat and spend the whole day there "
"Worth a visit!!"
"Stunning views overlooking the river! Fabulous that after hundreds of years you can still get an insight to what the castle would of been like! Friendly staff at both castle and museum across the green! "
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Beautiful castle, good museum and a visit to see the Ravens is a must. Absolute nightmare to find, poor signage for the car park. It’s by the police station by the way. Great day out for all ages. We saw a civil war re-enactment. .... just brilliant"
"Beautiful day at knaresborough"
"A glorious day spent in knaresborough castle stunning views plenty of space and seating museum worth a look"
"Ok"
"Nice you can go right up. Only pay for parts of it. Ravens were nice and great view. Worth a walk  if your passing but wouldnt make a special journey."
"Fine old ruin"
"This is a must-see  -  look down over River Nidd for the most scenic view in all England. Breathtaking!"
"Great"
"Great few hours out. The castle is very impressive and we had a bit of a tour around the underground part too. Learned a lot about the history and it was so well priced at £3.50 per adult for entrance into the castle and museum. Drinks and ice creams are available from the museum too and the gardens around it are beautiful to sit in. Will be returning!"
"Great"
"Great little gem we stumbled upon. Well worth a visit with amazing views. Lovely well kept gardens too"
"Best views in Knaresborough"
"Don't expect too much from the castle, interesting to look around, not extensive ruins, take the tour down the underground passage if open, old courthouse museum also worth a look.Views of the river and magnificent viaduct from the grounds are the jewel in Knaresborough's crown."
"Stunning position above the river"
"We visited on the windiest June morning we have ever known.....quite spectacular with the trees swaying & shedding twigs & leaves!! The situation above the river is quite breathtaking & the park area charming....a lovely place for a picnic."
"What a superb spot"
"We had it all on a Sunday morning.  Sunshine, views in various directions, ravens .. and it's free!  Hurrah!"
"More of a park than a castle"
"Most of the castle can be accessed without paying so it forms a nice backdrop to the park with lovely views of the river. The sections that you pay for are ok but only really for lovers of history rather than a casual tourist."
"Worth a look"
"Walked up from Mother Shipton's, rude not to. Paid our £3.50 enterance fee and had a bit of a guided tour. The tour included a walk through a hidden tunnel. The castle remains are not included on the tour. You are given a sheet to read what you are seeing. We then popped over to the medevil court room. Very interesting.We then had a wander around the grounds, some excellent views and photo opportunities.Not sure about on site parking as we left our car at Mother Shipton's. Didn't  notice any facilities."
"Worth a visit"
"Walked up to the castle after visiting Mother Shipton’s Cave.  A lovely place to visit.  Paid to go into the small museums there.  Staff were very informative and helpful."
"Raven Lady "
"Absolutely loved seeing the raven lady out in the castle grounds. She is very friendly and informative about the history of the Ravens and their links to the castle."
"Second trip there in about a year"
"I love the view from this hill top castle ruin.   The river below, great arch bridge and surrounding trees look picturesque. Take a tour round the ruins of the castle and you get entry to the museum included. We did not do that this time as we had done all that last time. Turn left into the gardens and there is a paddling pool there. This was a good stop for us as the weather was just great. You can walk down to the river but plenty of steps to go down. River walk is a must"
"Food with a view"
"This is an amazing place. It’s Lovely. Car park right next to it that is good value. I recommend you get a picnic and go and eat in the benches overlooking the viaduct. Stunning! "
"Great attraction in a great town"
"I visited on my own, and really enjoyed the castle and the town.  The castle was very good value, I think I paid £3.50, which gave access to the small castle tower, upstairs and down in the dungeon, a free guided tour which took about 15 minutes of the castle and the secret underground tunnel, and also included access into the Tudor Courtroom/museum.  Compared with the rip off that was Clifford's Tower in York (£5.40 and took me all of 5 minutes to walk around) I thought this was great value.  Lovely gardens to walk around (access to this part was free), lots of people picnicking, relaxing and enjoying the fabulous views over the town and the river.  Highly recommended."
"Castle visit"
"Visited with family, great few hours! Not much of the castle reminds but what we did see was good! Went into the secret tunnels and the views of Knaresborough are good! Great to visit for a picnic but not an all day visit! Good if you combine it with other attractions in the area!"
"Step back in time"
"We walked around the castle on our way back to our car. There was something beautiful and restful here, even though it was busy with couples and families enjoying the hot Bank Holiday weather. There was even a chance to handle a raven for a few minutes, while learning a bit about the history of them and their habits. Lovely bit of history with great views of the town. "
"Splendid views"
"Loved the walk around the castle and the views. Peaceful and tranquil. The grounds were relaxing for my picnic and read of my book too. "
"Ancient royal history comes alive here."
"Visit the royal tower if you can. The castle museum in the grounds is very good too. Fabulous views over the River Nidd."
"Beautiful Gardens in a lovely area"
"I recently organised an annual group break to Harrogate. I wanted to go to Knaresborough to relive my childhood. Not let down. The castle stands majestically above the River Nidd and the gardens inside the grounds were well laid out.It felt so peaceful there as the waters gently flowed under the much photoed viaduct.Not disappointed in fact I felt proud to have recommended this destination to the group."
"Terrific views "
"It’s a bit of a climb but the views are stunning over the river Nith, the ruins small but interesting but if you are visiting do make the effort "
"Historic ruins "
"Great view from here over the river and old aqueduct. Interesting story of the town in the courtroom museum. "
"Not a lot left of the castle but nice grounds "
"Had a walk through the grounds while having a day out in knaresborough the grounds are very well kept and the views over the river were great it was nice to see some ravens there we got chatting to the lady who was the queens official raven keeper  and she was very pleasent explained all about the ravens to us and even let me hold one on my hand infact I must say a special thank you to her for allowing me to do that and for been so pleasent "
"Great view "
"Not much left of the castle but a fantastic location overlooking the Nidd. The castle and the grounds are well maintained and the castle ravens are well worth seeing. Watch out for their salty language. "
"Great!"
"Peaceful steeped in history and well maintained grounds. Sit and take in the ambiance. Take a picnic. Visit the museum or just take a breather and enjoy the countryside."
"Interesting history and splendid view"
"We spent a couple of hours in Knaresborough on our way home and we need to go back. The castle gardens are worth a visit. They contain one of the towers open to the public and the old courthouse. The view across to the viaduct and down to the river is beautiful. We spent all our time in this area before our parking time ran out so we would like to return and explore some more. We didn’t get her name but the lady in the Tourist Information Office adjacent to the Town Square car park was very helpful and also provided us with a map."
"Brilliant views"
"A lovely evening stroll to the castle where we were very impressed with the views in both directions  ...to the viaduct one way and to the weir and old linen mills the other.... The war memorial that also stood in the castle grounds was the best kept I have ever seen with the copper plaques gleaming and the ability to read everyones name very clearly ."
"History "
"When you visit knaresborough, you have to see the castle, it's a tradition, now as this is a review, I'd like to keep the points I'm making honest. Being a Knaresborough resident, I see the castle very often, it is one of the most renown locations in Knaresborough.The grounds are kept very clean, even after the Bedrace day!I've been into the castle itself, I wasn't disappointed as it's history, history of which I'm proud to say is in my town. The grounds offer perfect ways to meet up with friends, as it is near Bebra gardens and they also host events, like the tour de France. Thank you. "
"Amazing Views"
"The Views from here are Amazing of the River Nidd and you dont have to pay an entrance fee to see these views or stroll round the Perimeter of the Castle.Although the Castle is mostly a shell there is the keep and the Amazing Sallyport which is a short tunnel with a fenced off entrance and steps An Admission fee has to be paid to enter the Keep and Sallyport but on certain event days free entrance can sometimes happen."
"A Piece of History "
"Always a lovely place to visit in a sunny day. Interesting history, lots to do and amazing views. The ravens are “fun” as well. Parking nearby and well worth a visit. "
"Lovely to see"
"Very beautiful with some very lovely sights. Great walk. The flowers around the grounds were very pretty"
"A Pleasant Stroll with Great Views"
"Knaresborough Castle is a historic ruin sitting up high above the river Nidd. The grounds are well kept with good paths which means you can stroll around and take in the views of the river below and the rather grand railway viaduct.There is a small museum on site, the resident ravens to view and also a portion of the old castle you can go into.You could easily spend an hour here, or as we did just walk around for 15 minutes and take in the views. "
"Pleasant Hour"
"We spent a pleasant hour in the grounds of the castle. Despite being a smallish area there is plenty to do from viewing the Ravens, playing a game of putting to visiting the onsite museum. We enjoyed the views of the river far below and just sat and soaked up the atmosphere and the April sunshine."
"lovely river view"
"nice castle not too much to see though however it has amazing river view; there is a free short stay parking (two hours) next to the Cross Keys Inn and a paid parking next to the castle and public toilets.use the stairs from the castle to go down to the river amazing walk and if the wether is good you can enjoy a boat rowing trip.Recommended if you like to enjoy few ours in a lovely place.-No fee to enter the area"
"Little Town"
"Castle ground are a nice area of Knaresborough with great views of the riverside and the viaduct. Has some good walks and cafes near by"
"Great family mini trip"
"We decided to have an impromptu trip to visit knaresborough castle, although the castle is on the smaller side our young children loved looking around the grounds and museum, the staff onsite we excellent and were very friendly both in the meuseum and castle both have lots of additional information to give, only £10 for a family ticket is well worth the 1.5-2 hours we spent around the area, and a nice walk around the town after as it’s all close by, the car park is right next to the castle and you can stay for up to 4 hours (look for the short stay car park)"
"Quite an interesting place. "
"Unfortunately we did not have time to visit the castle museum, but a walk round the castle grounds with its great views of the river is well recommended, there are plenty of boards pointing out various things about the castles history, we then walked down to the riverside, along past the cafes and boats, and then back along the main road into town, an excellent day out. "
"Amazing"
"Amazing views from the castle. Knaresborough is a really nice place to visit, especially when the weather is nice. It is very relaxing to visit this little town and go up to the castle."
"Lovely views"
"Parked up next to the castle,very cheap as well which is a nice surprise. Lovely views all round the castle, nice garden and could explore more if you wanted to walk down to the river."
" Beautiful Stop"
"On the train from Harrogate to York, we just decide to hop and walk..Great stop!Gorgeous views from the castle ruins!"
"Spectacular views"
"Well worth a visit for the views over the river & town alone.  Sadly we were unable to go into the best preserved part but thewr are some very interesting facts to be reads on the various information boards.  "
"Beautiful spot."
"Definitely a place to go if only for the vista. As you walk into the castle ruins, you can see what a beautiful spot it is, even though it is a ruin you can pick up on how spectacular it must have been. There is plenty around to tell you it's story and history but as you walk further through, towards the front....wow, just wow....the view over the valley and the river Nidd is just spectacular, looking out on the valley , the viaduct and the town below is just not to be missed....and it's all for free."
"Quick visit on way home"
"Had a quick walk round on the way home at the weekend.  Winter opening meant that the museum was not open.  Nevertheless, nice place to have a mooch.  Wandered down path into the town, which was quite nice. Would go back again in the summer, but I can image this being quite popular."
"Family Visit"
"The castle is a beautiful ruin with a small pleasant park and bowling green but the undoubted highlight is the stunning view."
"Amazing view point"
"The views from the castle overlooking the River Nidd and viaduct are breathtaking. You can access the castle from the town centre, if you would like to avoid the steep climb up from the riverside walk. Amazing & well worth a visit."
"Great walk"
"Went with some friends had a great walk had fun and it’s great for family walks or just walking the dog maybe even a picnic"
"Great views"
"A beautiful walkabout. The castle ruins look down at the River Nidd. Fantastic views. I was too early to visit the courtroom museum but it sounds fascinating ."
"Set in a commanding position."
"A really great start, to a short break, would be to find your way to this special Yorkshire medieval castle; with well maintained grounds and parkland nearby."
"Lovely castle"
"There were rooks on display. Lovely views down over the river and beautiful gardens. Will definitely visit again."
"The Castle"
"A superb place to visit with totally stunning views overlooking the river Nidd . There is a viaduct running across the river with trains running over ever 30 mins during the summer months a steam train runs over the viaduct a must take picture brilliant"
"Views"
"Beautiful  place place and quiet for picnics      Views of river and arches plus scenery magnificent so peaceful"
"Lovely castle ruins"
"There's not much left of Knaresborough castle but it's such a beautiful spot and well worth a visit. Just stand at the top and look down towards the river and let your mind drift back to what it was like in its heyday. Brilliant views in such wonderful surroundings."
"The place from which to see Knaresborough."
"Knaresborough is a small, old-fashioned market town a few miles from Harrogate (about ten minutes on the train). It is fairly hilly and probably not ideally suited to someone with less good mobility. The castle ruin sits just off the main town square and is, frankly, not a great deal to see, but it commands a fantastic view of the river Nidd below and of the famous viaduct across which the train passes coming and going from the local station. The day we were there, the weather was a bit dour - misty and very damp - but we still enjoyed a walk around the town (you can see pretty much the whole place in a couple of hours of gentle strolling), which is in need of a bit of care and attention, but not without its charm. Probably much better in spring and summer, but a worthwhile place for a short visit - especially for that view from the castle."
"Stunning view"
"Short little visit with a breathtaking view - makes me wish I could paint.  Castle ruins are lovely as well, and a nice war memorial for the locals.  Absolutely worth a stop."
"Gorgeous Views"
"We went for a Christmas Break on Boxing Day the village was so quiet and the views were just spectacular, we took our little one along on her scuttle bug , there were lots of stairs so Mabey not ideal with pushchair. "
"Lovely old castle with amazing views over the River Nidd"
"We just stumbled upon this castle by chance. Glad we went- Amazing views over the River Nidd and the Roman Viaduct"
"Wow"
"Steeped in history, the views from here are amazing. Beautiful place to visit. The town has some fab shops too."
"Weekend with friends"
"Sunday afternoon  stroll along the river and up into the town for the xmas market then through the castle and back down to the river. What a stunning little bit of heaven, the views are really beautiful and the people are warm and friendly"
"Fantastic views of the gorge."
"Some fantastic views and photo opportunities here. The castlle grounds are really well maintained and extremely clean and tidy. "
"Lovely view"
"Visited on way home from Harrogate,  it was Sunday so everything closed, walked up to the castle ruin and viewed the river and aqueduct, lady in black had 3 ravens with her, apparently they are very naughty ravens, nice place for a couple of hours visit"
"The Ravens of Knaresborough"
"The views from the castle are amazing. The Tower of London has its ravens, so does Knaresborough Castle. Don't let them see your sandwiches or other food as they won't hesitate to grab it."
"Well worth a visit from Harrogate"
"We took the train from Harrogate, one every 30mn. Knaresborough village is a delight. We took the Gallons steps to the river Kidd, looked at the viaduct, walked along the river and  walked up to the castle,  not much left of it but very pretty. There is a nice big square and busy high street but it feels very different from Harrogate."
"Beautiful and peaceful"
"We walked the castle grounds all the way to the bottom. They have a couple of cafes if you time it right. We saw ducks so I stayed a while to watch them. There are shops along the main road before you enter so we will have to return to check them out. Be careful going down the stairs as they are broad and different sizes. Free entrance.  Limited handicap parking available. "
"Great views. "
"We love coming here! Such lovely grounds. Cool castle. And great views. If you continue walking you can walk along the water. It’s beautiful. Love coming to visit! "
"Beautiful Scenery "
"The view here is just gorgeous during autumn.  A very nice place to go if you are into photography.  The famous bridge of Knaresborough is located here.  Be sure to walk along all the paths to soak in those beautiful scenes.  "
"Lovely setting"
"Visited at dusk but lovely views of the viaduct. Very peaceful. Situated just off the high street in Knaresborough."
"Interesting"
"This place has a fascinating history that is partly explained by the various notices distributed around the picturesque castle grounds. Sadly, the museum was closed (closed for winter months)  as I'm sure this would greatly enhanced the visit. If you like castles, it's worth a look and you can also take the path down to the riverside walk along the River Nidd Waterside."
"Worth a visit"
"The castle is just a ruin (thank Oliver Cromwell for that) but the views from the grounds are beautiful. It is worth the climb. On a clear day, you can see for miles."
"Watch out for the ravens!"
"The view from the castle ruins - across the river and the railway viaduct are stunnign and must be one of the most photographed scenes in Yorkshire. There' not much left of the castle, but you can say hello to the ravens and learn about their ""bad manners"". Then walk down to the river where you can hire a boat or simply take the walk to either bridge (we did both and found The Half Moon pub if you turn left at the foot of the stairs). Very enjoyable even in October!"
"Worth the view "
"The view over the aqueduct is amazing, especially on a sunny day in autumn with all the colours! The castle ruins offer a nice photo opportunity as well and a perfect place for a picnic and a rest after the riverside walk. "
"Great views"
"The castle and the grounds have great views across the river and Knaresborough. There is a small museum in the grounds and a few information boards about the castle."
"Very good"
"The grounds are free to get in and have stunning so views over the river and beyond. The view up the river looking at the railway bridge is one of the most famous in the town. It is in many pictures and painting. Once you see it you will understand why.There are a number of very good walks round the town."
"Wonderful views!"
"The castle is predominantly ruins, but has a nice atmosphere, and the views over the river and to the railway bridge are beautiful. Don't go out of your way to go there, but equally don't just drive through the town without stopping to see it."
"The Best View In Knaresborough"
"Came here many years ago and luckily not much has changed apart from the inability to climb on the castle, which you could get away with 20 years back. Then again, my knees wouldn't put up with it now either. It's an idyllic and friendly place. The gardens are always well-kept and the view is stunning. If you fancy a bit of excersise you can always walk down to the river and then try and not give yourself a cardiac coming back up! Many an aimless day in my twenties with a bag of chips and a lovely lady on my arm. A place to make memories. Enchanting."
"Great views"
"When visiting North Yorkshire, we often take in a view at Knarsbourough. The Castle area provides excellent views of the riverside and environs. Your are also just very short walk from the town’s electic mix of local shops."
"Nice place for a picnic in fine weather"
"Charming open space high above the river with the castle ruins sitting right on the edge giving lovely views. A popular dog walking area. Right in the centre of Knaresborough which is a great place to look around with well preserved old buildings and a ""windows trail"" making it very interesting. Get a map from the Tourist Office and try to find all the painted ""windows""."
"Excellent Views"
"Take a picnic and enjoy the day with the views and atmosphere of community. The Ravens are great and go when the museum and castle are open for a fuller day. "
"Lovely amenity area in the middle of the town"
"We visited Knaresborough on the way north and had a lovely walk around the castle with its far reaching views. The dog enjoyed his walk and there were plenty of dog bins plus public toilets. Unfortunately the weather was rather grim so I look forward to exploring the riverside on my next visit."
"wonderful views"
"easy parking at this site and pretty walks although several steep steps to encounter in places. outstanding view of the viaduct over the river and nearby cafes offer delicious refreshments. well worth a walk and the gardens are beautfully maintained."
"Simply stunning!"
"A fantastic view from this high spot of beautiful Knaresborough. Definitely not to be missed on a visit here!"
"The grounds offer great views."
"We did not go in as we were too early. However the grounds are worth a visit on their own. There are great views to the viaduct and river below. A photographers dream."
"Lovely  views"
"Lovely place often go down there to take in the views.Well worth a visit. The remains of the castle is small there is also a museum  very close."
"Lovely castle with amazing views"
"After lunch at a nearby bistro we had a stroll through the grounds of the castle and were wowed by the beauty of the local scene. Very picturesque!"
"Lovely place for a walk"
"Really nice place to walk about and fantastic views and when you finish it’s lovely to take a walk down by the river"
"River view"
"Spent an hour here whilst visiting town centre, couple of minutes walk from centre and next to a car park if required. As previously stated not much to see but interesting history non the less, information boards are dotted around and the views over the river Nidd are superb, visit if in area but don't make a trip just for this."
"Not much to see"
"There wasn't a lot of the castle to see. The best bit was the Ravens who are kept at the castle. The warden told us about them and we even heard one of them saying hello., yes a talking Raven! fascinating. Maybe the museum and Tudor Courtroom would have made it  a bit more interesting but even though it was a Saturday it was closed so that's why i have marked it average"
"Interesting history with commanding views over the River Nidd"
"Although there is little left of the castle it’s history is interesting. A few interpretation boards help visitors understand the area and its importance.  More than anything, the views over the river valley are wonderful. While there, take the opportunity to visit the Bebra Gardens and walk down to the river and wander along the riverbank."
"Not much of a castle really"
"As you can't get in to the castle I have no idea what it is really like as I could just see the outside which didn't tell. Museum was closed for some reason so couldn't find out anything. Standing outside the castle you do get amazing views of the river and viaduct. Also there wAs a lady there with lots of different ravens which was interesting."
"free entry and stunning views over Knaresborough"
"Not often is a castle free to get in, so this was a bonus. However, we paid an fee to go to what we thought would be the top of the tower but felt a bit conned that it only takes us up to a concrete platform where there aren't any views we'd hoped for, so don't bother extra for that when you are there. The ravens are interesting although one or two can be grumpy. One little girl was screaming because one of the ravens had taken her shoe. It was recovered and given back to her though. The views from the grounds were simply stunning so definitely worth going for those alone if nothing else."
"Great views"
"Well worth a visit to see these castle. There is a lovely well planted area with benching to sit on and enjoy the views.  "
"Informative"
"Set in beautiful surroundings the ruins ate definitely worth visiting. Owned by The Queen with public use it is very well maintained. The gardens are beautiful and the views of the town, river and railway bridge are magnificent. Worth visiting "
"Come for the View"
"Loved the view from the castle area looking out to the village which cascades down the hill to the river and the old, stately viaduct which was built in 1851.  Great photography spot!"
"Stunning views!"
"Walked up here after visiting old mother shiptons cave and glad we did. Beautiful views, interesting old bits of castle and a great photo spot."
"Small castle"
"This Castle and grounds are lovely on a nice day. Very windy otherwise.  It has a lovely view. But it's overpriced for what you see inside."
"Not much to see!"
"The gardens were lovely and well tended. The castle itself was destroyed so not much left to see. The museum was closed when we went so it was a bit disappointing. "
"No hassle at this castle. "
"I have visited many many castles in my life. Some have been well worth the visit...... others have been but a short stop without much left to see or do. These ruins with a small museum and some fine views is worth a bit of your time. Don't expect too much."
"interesting"
"We just looked around the outside and the grounds there where some lovely views. The grounds are really good great for families. Also some very friendly ravens"
"Pretty"
"So pretty to visit.  The castle and town well worth a visit when in the area.  The castle was very good and educational"
"Nice park"
"The castle is a partial ruin of the original castle.  It has a great view of the river below and a nice park"
"Great place for historical facts and just relax in the grounds."
"Fascinating place, friendly staff full of historical information, great views and wonderful green spaces to sit and picnic.  Do pay for the museum and castle as you get more understanding of the place and its not that much.  "
"First visit"
"Very impressive, owned by HM The Queen. Well kept area, good value for money - entrance fee. Lovely viewing area, Ravens on view."
"Beautiful views from the castle."
"Very good visit if only for the views. Visited by bus from Harrogate and returned by train. Town is very good, many restaurants, cake and pie shops so you will not go hungry! Castle is a ruin but the views of the river below and the railway bridge are exceptional."
"Heart of Knaresborough"
"The Castle itself is a ruin.  It still has a a couple buildings to visit, but the draw are the views from the grounds over the River Nidd, and the gardens and grounds.  People play sports, hear concerts, visit on brunches, have picnics, take photos, and take leisurely walks all around.  It is very accessible because the town is built around it.  Lovely place to be."
"Lovely afternoon at Knaresborough Castle"
"Lovely afternoon looking around Knaresborough market and shops and then a walk around the castle grounds.  If you are up for it you can go in a rowing boat down the river.  Alternatively you can do what I did and call to the ice cream shop and sit and watch the others rowing down the river.  Ice cream shop is definitely worth a visit.  On a warm day there is a paddling pool for the children to play in.  Take a picnic and chill out."
"Great Views"
"This is a nice place to visit whilst in Knaresborough with a great view over the river.  Good opportunities for photos."
"Interesting historical point"
"The guided tour was worth doing, you get some historical context for the castle and you get to go underground into the Sallyport."
"Great place."
"This is a great place with wonderful views, castle Ravens and flowers galore. Very easy to walk around with close parking. Although a very steep walk to the river."
"Family meal"
"First meals cold second cold waiter told waiter was offended this is a celebration for 91 year lady and so far it's a disastrous night manager informed he tried to put it right but completely spoiled the night. Sorry but this establishment has been very lucky in getting 1 starManager did try but the moment had passed."
"nice"
"very nice on a good weather day with good walks but all so good hills scenery was very nice and picture book "
"Castle "
"Lovely place to visit. It's quiet close to the city center. When you are there, you can have a chance overlook the river and the bridge. Besides, it looks gorgeous while the sun shining."
"Great location"
"Whether visiting, living or working in Knaresborough the castle has something for everybody. If you're visiting you may not even be aware that it is there. Located by one of the towns main car parks and the police station it is just off the high street. A great place to bone up on history,have an al fresco lunch or just to take in some breath taking views of the valley and river below. Watch out for the regular displays by local guides dressed in period costume. Part of a good circular walk route from Old Mother Shipton's, up to the High Street, into the castle then take the steps down to the river back to the start point."
"Surprise visit.."
"We only stopped in Knaresborough for breakfast, thought we would take a look at the Castle, wow, what a tremendous view, lovely grounds, we will be back next year to stay a little longer.. "
"Interesting"
"Had a trip into Knaresborough recently and decided to call to the castle.  The view from the castle grounds is stunning.  The castle itself has quite a bit of history and there is a museum in the grounds also.  Worth a visit"
"loverly views"
"nice day out, loverly views from the castle gardens of the river and surrounding area. enjoyed the rowing boats ."
"Castle with a view "
"A beautifully kept Castle - owned by her majesty the Queen and made available to her subjects. Bowling lawn/club. Gorgeous grounds (dog friendly :))))"
"Glimpse the past"
"We called here on a beautiful Sunday morning. Fantastic view down to the river. Not much castle left but what there is was very interesting with a nearby museum telling the history of the place. "
"Castle, Museum and Grounds"
"We went first to the museum and bought tickets to cover it and the castle. As we were told that no-one would be able to admit us to the castle for about 40 minutes, we did the museum first and then strolled around the grounds. The entry fee is very reasonable and it is free if you don't want to go into the buildings..The museum is small but manages to contain a lot of interesting material - including a shirt in which someone was beheaded!! It gives a very good over-view of local history and characters.It was a very breezy day but sunny. We walked around the top parts of the ground and went from windswept to tranquil in a matter of steps! It would be possible to find a sheltered spot without too much trouble if you just wanted to sit for a while.The views over the River Nidd were gorgeous and we were particularly taken with the ""Castle Ravens"". The grounds were lovely and it was fun to watch various families playing bowls (there is also a putting green on site but we didn't see anything happening there). Our last stop was the remains of the castle that could be entered. It a small site but it is possible to visit three different levels in the tower."
"Always neat gardens"
"Well worth a visit, it's kept in lovely order, well maintained gardens and lovely views of surrounding areas"
"Stroll around the Castle"
"Beautiful Knaresborough Castle.Has stunning views over the river .And its free to walk round the stunning grounds.Definately worth a visit .Just sich a stunning area of North Yorkshire.Knaresbourough Castle is a gem . "
"Amazing views."
"Nice walks and stunning views around the are of the castle. Good walking shoes if you go down the steps to the river and walk round to the Mitre for good food and beers."
"Okay for history buffs"
"Not my cup of tea but is a great tourist attraction.  Lots of history to learn, with great views over the river Nidd and the viaduct.  Children, and adults alike, can pet the ravens and get a photo taken holding one of them."
"Even on a very wet day the view was lovely"
"Bit of a wet hike up after visiting Mother Shiptons Cave, and it was raining heavily once at the castle, but the view towards the viaduct and beyond was lovely."
"Beautiful grounds and views"
"Worth going to Knaresborough for the beautiful scenery alone especially seen from castle.Unfortunately not too much left of the castle but still well worth a look it has beautiful gardens and a bowling green and the views over surrounding area are breath taking especially the view of the River Nidd and the viaduct.Also check out castle museum its not very big but interesting.Will definitely visit again."
"Scenic castle ruins"
"Knaresborough Castle occupies one of the most scenic spots I have ever visited, with stunning views over the River Nidd and the railway viaduct. We met several of the ravens which live at the castle, under the watchful eye of their keeper. There isn't much to see in castle itself, but we took the guided tour of the sally-port, or secret passageway, which was interesting. The entrance fee to the castle and museum (combined ticket) is very reasonable: £3.50 for an adult, £2.50 concession (including 60+). It was annoying that some people tagged onto the sally-port tour without paying. Perhaps those who have bought their tickets could be given a sticker so that the guides aren't put in the position of having to challenge anyone / let non-payers in (which latter tends to be the default position - I have witnessed it before in other tours which start in the open air)."
"Lovely walk with stunning views"
"We visit Knaresborough a few times a year and always visit the castle just for the views which are outstanding. On our last visit we were lucky enough to see the cheeky Royal Ravens and Raven Keeper.  We took the steps down to the river but we always make our way back to the castle by other routes of which there are many. All of the routes have something of interest, a park, quirky old buildings, paddling pools etc always finish with a cuppa in one of the many cafes. Plenty to see."
"Great views"
"Loved the walks. Also got some fantastic pictures. Saw some cool b&b's at the bottom of of the castle. Perhaps something to consider for our next trip. "
"Beautiful"
"What a wonderful place!! Fantastic views from the castle and a really nice place to walking around!  Parking was close by too."
"Nice photo op"
"Unfortunately the castle is in a poor state with grafitti and litter. This appears to be down to a lack of resources. Very sad to see. Despite that the staff are extremely friendly and professional. The best part is the escape tunnel which is home to an endangered species of cave spider. Check when tour times are on before going.The surrounding area is a nice place for lunch and a beautiful view."
"Good "
"A bit expensive at it's full price but they do knock the price down from time to time. Does provide a little history to the area"
"Lovely castle!"
"Visited the other Wednesday and what a lovely place it is! Didn't actually go into the museum as we were short of time. The whole castle grounds were exquisitely well kept and offered great views down to the river and he viaduct. Not a huge castle but well worth the visit even if only passing by. "
"Wonderful photo opportunities "
"Knaresborough Castle is perched on top of a high cliff and as such, the views are magnificent. The steps to reach the castle are steep but there are opportunities to sit down along the way. The castle is only wheelchair accessible from the town (not from the unless by car). We always visit the castle when spending the day in Knaresborough."
"Gem in countryside"
"My dad was in England 41 years ago, and he visited this site.In 2017, we visited England and we visited Knaresborough Castle again.Scenary from the castle was awesome."
"Lucky day to visit"
"We had our usual walk to the castle before descending down to the river via the steps only to find artists easels scattered around the grounds. It transpired Sky tv were filming for their Sky Arts competition and Frank Skinner , Joan Bakewell and the judges were mulling around interviewing the artists who had some very interesting entries of varying styles. Great couple of hours spent."
"Beautiful views"
"If you are ever visiting Harrogate, you must take time out to visit the lovely Yorkshire market town of Knaresborough.  A super market place is just a short distance to the castle where in fairness there isn't a great deal to see, but the lovely gardens, the beautiful bowling green and the magnificent views over the River Nidd towards the railway viaduct means that a trip to the castle is a must do.  Check out the Ravens - see if you can hear one of them talk! "
"Wonderful "
"I had a stroll around here before I had a fabulous lunch at the Mother Shipton Inn just down the hill. The castle is really well kept and there was a brass band playing on the park lawn. It was very pleasant just to chill out and sit on the lawn in the sun watching the world go by.Recommended to all, young and old"
"Peaceful and relaxing"
"I lovely stop off on the way home from Harrogate.Such a peaceful and relaxing place to have a sit down or wander around.There's a also a very nice little bakery on the corner of the main street opposite the bus stops."
"Get there by 4.00 or miss the Museum -a lovely ruined Castle."
"This castle ruined in the civil war because it Royalist Charles 1,offers fantastic views across the town and the River Nidd. Not much is left and it is in care of English Heritage. The castle outlines can be seen and it was in its time a large castle. There are beautiful gardens set in the ruins and even a space garden done by local children. Alas I arrived from York too late to tour the museum set in what became a large home and then a court house. The two kind ladies in charge did have a chat and showed me the ancient court room by the entrance with its ancient pews and high bench for the judge, small but very wooden by today`s standards. I hope I get back to learn more, without a 29 year gap this time. There is a small charge for the Museum."
"Castle games"
"Not much of the castle left as it was held for Charles I. What is left is full of information and museum goers get to play golf and blowing free."
"Lovely "
"Lovely - bargain to get into the castle and museum - the rooms and details for the castle are really easy to follow."
"Idyllic views. Interesting tour."
"The ruined castle offers beautiful views across the town and river - it is the best vantage point in Knaresborough. We joined a guided tour of the castle that was interesting in the history it told and engaging in the way (and length of time) it was done. The tour is well worth doing to gain access to the tunnel that leads out under the wall."
"Wonderful views over the river"
"We walked along the river from the car park and clibed to the castle. The effort was really wothwhile as the castle is interesting, and the view from the top is outstanding."
"Nice little castle"
"This little castle is on a beautiful site and the grounds and museum are in excellent condition. You get a lovely view of the famous railway viaduct and the surrounding countryside. Don't miss the ravens -- we got a chance to talk with the ""Raven Lady"".Worth visiting if you are in the area."
"Good"
"Its ok but theres not much left of it to be honest, so not allot to see at all. There were some talking Raven birds there though which was funny."
"Great opportunity"
"I've been before with children and again with a pensioner.  Views and photo opportunities are great.  History is well presented and fascinating.  First time down the Sally Port on this occasion, ask for times of guided tours.  Local band playing on Sunday afternoon in the sun."
"Bit dissapointed"
"We have been a few times to Knaresborough and loved it. The views from the castle grounds are amazing. They look over on the the River Nidd where you can see the rowing boats. We went in the castle for the first time today and it is very small. There isn't much to see. We paid £3.50 each and for 5 minutes I don't think it's worth it. "
"Lovely view"
"Stunning vielse and much to see. Didn't stay as long as I would have liked to may have stayed longer had I had the chance to do so. Must see ."
"Great Views"
"Not a lot to see it's quite small, the castle gardens are really nice, the views are to die for, and their is boules and a museum too here, and lots of walks, the castle is very pretty from the outside, but it's small as I said, but once you have been in you've done it."
"Beautiful"
"Definitely, one to visit! Knaresborough is a beautiful little town and there are nice things to see. The view from the Castel is magnificent. Well worth a day visit."
"Bank holiday visit "
"Always a winner to take visitors to as the keep and sallyports are a must-see. The view is obviously iconic but there's more to it on bank holidays where sealed knot (or similar) run displays and stalls that the kids love. Always good to see the ravens, too. "
"Picturesque View"
"We took a walk up the steep to Knareborugh Castle from the river Nidd and depending on the time of year the Impressive Ravens were on display. There is not too much of the castle left but it's set in neatly kept pleasant grounds. But I suppose the highlight is the actual picturesque view if the viaduct that crosses the river Nidd"
"Great view of the town"
"Fantastic views over the town.  Interesting history. Entry to the grounds is free. Well worth a visit. "
"Great ruins ,lovely gardens ,superb view of the Nidd gorge"
"A nice garden to walk in immediately adjacent to the town centre. Some super benches to sit on too.Idyllic!"
"Lovely place to sit and relax"
"We visited Knaresborough and had a look around the castle grounds.  We went into the museum which I found most factually interesting.  We sat and relaxed in front of the viaduct which was lovely to look at,  Worth a visit."
"Lovely walk and panoramic views"
"I have been here three times with different people, It was a quick train ride from Harrogate where we were staying .. Its a beautiful walk and scenery, and some lovely eating places along the river.. Brilliant"
"Breathtaking Views"
"The remains of this castle sit nestled in the town of Knaresborough, U.K. and is easy to access once you've parked your vehicle. It's free to walk around although much of the castle has perished over the past few hundred years there's still plenty of castle remaining. There's a breathtaking view over the countryside and also over the river. Spectacular and well worth a look!"
"Vantage point "
"Well presented and well worth the visit. Very well kept with wonderful views and interesting historical focus"
"Well kept castle grounds and ruins"
"Well worth a visit for the panoramic views over the river and the trail to Mother Shiptons Cave. The grounds are particularly well maintained and there are plenty of benches to rest your weary feer"
"What a beautiful place"
"Knaresborough is like going back in time. Around the castle is the most beautiful views. There are ravens there quite tame and a lady who looks after them. The setting is spectaculiar"
"Fit it in with a trip to mother Shiptons caves "
"Not a great deal to see but loads of history here and an important part of our past. Fantastic views and great as part of a package trip including the town market, caves etc. Then go and visit Harrogate. Another gorgeous town. "
"Great Attraction!"
"After visiting Mother Shiptons Cave, closely followed by ""The End of The World"" for beers in their beer garden, we tok a stroll along the river bank and then climbed up to the Castle.  The views from the top are wonderful!  Got Pick-pocketed .....by a Raven!  yes...a Raven.  There were two which had leg ties on them to stop them flying away and as I stood talking, one of them actually unzipped my coat pocket and removed a bunch of business cards where upon it destroyed one of them!Well worth the climb!"
"Knaresborough castle"
"This was our first visit inside the castle,it cost around £10 for 2 adults and 3 children and this includes a visit to the museum too on the same day. We all enjoyed exploring the castle and the lovely views from it. Worth a visit. The museum was good to look around too,the kids loved dressing up and playing with the toys. "
"Must See Simply For The View"
"We paid the castle a very quick visit during our recent stay in Knaresborough.As others have said, there's not a great deal to do here, but, that said, the views alone are well worth making time to visit the castle.The castle grounds, though small, are beautifully kept and delightful to walk around or simply sit and relax on a sunny day.However, it's the view of the railway bridge over the River Nidd and the homes in the hills that make this location a must see part of Knaresborough."
"Walk around Knaresborough Castle"
"We parked by the river Nidd and very reasonable and walked around the market town which brought us to the castle. The history is interesting and free to walk around.  Not a lot of the castle left now but many seats to sit and look at the wonderful views of the River Nidd. You can hire boats quite cheaply for an hours entertainment and plenty of places to get refreshment. You can visit Mother Shipton's cave and  treat yourself to an ice cream when leaving. A lovely market town to visit"
"Knaresborough Castle - Fantastic Views"
"I've visited Knaresborough Castle numerous times and every time I go I discover something different. To be honest, there's not much left of the castle, but what it offers is the most fantastic views over the River Nidd and the chequered viaduct that crosses it.If you feel quite active, you can walk down the hundreds of steps to the River Nidd itself and maybe take a pleasure cruise using one of the rowing boats that you can hire. A small selection of cafes and ice cream vendors also populate the river bank.On the other side of the River Nidd lies the Mother Shipton's cave attraction, where lime filled water 'putrefies' objects.At the side of the castle there is a small pitch and putt and bowling green, and the tools for use can be obtained from the little shop near the castle entranceMy most favourite time to visit the castle is in summer, when the sun is on full display. The views are stunning.Just behind the castle is a café and behind that is the main Knaresborough market square which is great to visit. This is where you can park on a pay and display car park, or you can park on the roads nearby using a timing card obtained from local shops for about 90 minutes max ( N.B in some places it is only 30 minutes so read the signs carefully  as the traffic wardens are keen ! )All in all a great place to go."
"Brisk walk around Knaresborough "
"I walked down to tye river to see the viaduct and the castle from below and then up the steps to the castle itself, which was a good way to warm up on a chilly afternoon "
"Well worth a visit"
"Excellent to drop into this lovely market town - parking by the Police station, itself close by the Castle. Plenty of independent shops and altogether a pleasant intimate feel to the place. Wednesday is, I gather, the market day"
"Castle visit "
"Visited Knaresborough Castle with my husband and my parents. Was a lovely day as there was entertainment on. However it says on the website that the castle is open until 4pm. Went at 3.30pm to go in and was told that while the museum was open until 4pm the castle wasn't. Still able to walk around the grounds and it is a fantastic castle ruin."
"A Pleasing Prospect"
"There’s not much left of this picturesque old ruin with its lovely views over the river & railway viaduct. Entry is free, the gardens are well tended & colourful. We took the Castle Keep , Sallyport and Tudor Courtroom tour @ £2.50. The little museum by the courtroom was interesting but the trip down the ancient sallyport was fascinating. Well worth a visit."
"Lovely place "
"Had a quick visit this time it is a beautiful place and this time there was a  group of re-enactment people there although we didn't get to speak to them. The view from the castle is amazing recommend to anyone "
"Lovely place to wander and take in the view"
"You can wander into the castle grounds for free, and it's a delightful way to spend an hour, as the gardens are beautifully tended and the views of the River Nidd and the viaduct are wonderful. There is a small museum that I think has an entry fee but we passed on this and went for afternoon tea in the town instead. Highly recommended, especially if you've never visited Knaresborough before, like me!"
"Good view point"
"Good view from the path overlooking the gorge at the river and bridge,the ruin provides a backdrop for photos.The gardens around the castle are colorful and well kept"
"Quaint castle"
"Stopping in Knaresborough on our way home from our short break we wanted to look at the castle. A castle ruins with fabulous views. The staff were very friendly and helpful. A nice short visit."
"Castle Heights"
"A lovely area to wander and sit and watch the world go by. Great views up the river Nidd. Access down to the riverside albeit there are many steps. Or wander into Bebra Gardens and access the riverside from there."
"Great day out"
"The Castle grounds are well maintained and the views of the River are stunning. You can walk from the castle down to the river where you can find cafes, shops, ice cream shops. You can take a boat on the river also which on a sunny day is heaven. Knaresborough itself is a quaint market town close to Harrogate. There are many shops , cafes and restaurants.The walk along the river is fantastic and a must do on any visit. You can see the grounds of Mother Shiptons Cave across the river which is another lovely attraction for the area.On a lovely summers day this would be a great family day out."
"Lovely grounds and view."
"Visited here in easter and it was a lovely setting. Lovely gardens and surroundings and even a little golf putting greens and bowling greens. Not alot to do but good to pop onto as you saunter through knaresborough."
"Nice piece of History!"
"Lovely gardens, views and nice to see a piece of history! Only £3.50 to visit the Castle which includes entry to the museum."
"Ravens amusing"
"It was a very cold windy day when we visited, there was fantastic views of the viaduct, and the Ravens were very amusing"
"Worth seeing "
"Visited here the other day with my friend and we had a nice time. It was £3.50 for an adult ticket and this included access to the Courthouse museum. The castle itself isn't very big, mainly two small rooms, the roof (which had a good view) and the dungeon. Being the school holidays, they had somebody doing demonstrations of medieval weaponry which was interesting. Outside had some nice grounds but they did have some creepy ravens lurking around tied up. Worth a visit. "
"Terrific views"
"A really historic and interesting castle that was allegedly King John's favourite. It was besieged by Cromwell's forces in the Civil War which explains its ruinous state. There is still a lot to see, and the views over the river are amazing. Well worth the visit."
"Worth a visit if you are in town"
"The ruins of the castle are not a lot to look at but its worth joining the tour. Its the first time I have heard of and been though a sally port, I understand this is quite a unique feature as many sally ports have collapsed and/or become inaccessible. Entrance fee to the castle also get you entry to the museum which is small but interesting. "
"Beautiful views!"
"We were stopping in Harrogate so went to Knaresborough one day and we are very glad we did, the castle grounds are beautiful! The view down to the river is stunning and we sat and watched the world go by for quite a while. It was nice to see the Ravens there and a see how well the castle grounds are kept. A definite stop off point for anybody in the area!"
"An absolutely stunning place, extremely peaceful"
"We came across the castle by accident because we parked in the car park adjoining the castle grounds. We were unable to actually go in the castle because it didn't open until Easter. However the grounds were superb. Extremely well kept and very colourful. The views are breathtaking. There are plenty of places to just sit and ponder. Everywhere was so very peaceful. Absolutely no noise polution, just the train in the distance. Whoever is responsible for the upkeep of the grounds deserves to be very proud, they are absolutely manicured and the planting is so colourful. I'd recommend this place to anyone."
"Lovely Town"
"Stopped off here on our way back from Scarborough we usually just drive through to save driving through Harrogate, after all these times what a mistake it was not to stop. Lovely town, walked around the castle grounds some stunning views and saw the Ravens and a post explaining about them. Lots of shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants around the castle. Plenty of parking and seating area in the square nice to sit in the sunshine with a drink and a bite to eat, definitely worth a visit if your in the area"
"Stunning "
"Went to visit Knaresborough and yes the weather was poor but what a stunning place. Beautiful walk along the river. Lots of cafés,  ice cream parlours and eaters. Good views from the castle.  Parking is cheap compared to some places. Look out for the wooden carvings. "
"Stunning view"
"We were staying with friends over Easter and decided to have a walk through the town and by the river. The views of the river & the stunning aqueduct are fantastic. We didn't go in the castle"
"Price included more than expected"
"My boyfriend and I visited this castle this Easter. We didn't expect much for the price (£3.50 for adults and £2.00 for children) and the keep ruins were quite small. However there was more than we thought. Beautiful grounds full of colourful flowers and neat kept grass. Also included in the price was a short tour that took you under the grounds in a secret passageway used hundreds of years ago, access to all areas of the keep and access to a small museum in the old courthouse. There is a short stay car park right opposite the castle and at £1.60 for 4 hours, decently priced as well as convenient! What I would recommend is to take a warm coat as it can be cold and windy with the grounds being above a river  and to use a post code on the satnav for Knaresborough and follow the signs for the castle and museum as the postcode for the castle took us to a back street and we couldn't see the castle! The castle is only round the corner from the historic market place so you can pop for a pub lunch after your visit. The museum also has a little game area that the kids should enjoy and you can walk down to the river walkway if you wish. Some steps are worn so be careful!"
"Beautiful views across the river nidd"
"Lovingly looked after and fabulous views across the horizon. Maintained gardens and open spaces.. free to enter!"
" Stunning View Of Knaresborough "
"It was a lovely sunny day when my wife and I went, and you get an absolutely superb view over Knaresborough to the viaduct.  There is bowling and a putting green for a small fee and two little museums which we didn't go in.  We only spent about 20 mins there mainly admiring the sights and views. Probably if you did the museums and some of the activities you could maybe kill an hour or so. "
"Very clean and interesting. Love the ravens. "
"Beautiful setting, right at the top of the town. Immaculate lawns and grounds and friendly staff. The ravens were beautiful and their handlers friendly. Would recommend. "
"Half a Castle"
"There are far better castle remains in the north of England. This was little more than a Tower with little to see. View of the River Nidd was good but little more could be said.for this attraction. "
"Beautiful view"
"What a fantastic view from the castle looking over towards the viaduct.  Well worth a trip and don't forget your camera"
"The Castle"
"Set in beautiful well maintained ground's we visited on a sunny Sunday morning the castle wasn't open but it was lovely all the same worth a look for the beautiful view's over the river and  the well cared for memorial garden."
"Great trip out"
"Lots of information that the kids really enjoyed - the castle is only small but has a dungeon which the kids loved and a secret escape tunnel which the kids loved - you have to be there at the right time for the tour of the tunnel which we happened to be luckily. Lovely garden with great views as well for the kids to run around. It's in the centre of Knaresborough town centre too so easy to get to. Think it cost £10 for our family of five and that was access to the castle, tour of the tunnel and small museum across from the castle. Would definitely recommend. "
"Ruined castle"
"I love castles and this was obviously a major one in its time.   Large and in a good strategically defensive point over the river Nidd.   Unfortunately the keep was not open on the day we visited but the war memorial had the first Rounding I have seen on one.   Made my week. "
"Nice for a couple of hours out."
"Lovely views and gardens, the town is nice, plenty of little shops, not a huge amount to do or see but kept us occupied for a couple of hours."
"Worth a look"
"Some good info boards, and lovely views on a sunny day. Nice gardens and space for children to have a run about."
"Passing through"
"Nice place with great views. Easy parking and good bars and restaurants nearby. Busy little town especially on market day.  "
"Good for 5min stop off!"
"Lovely little castle and garden. Fantastic views of the railway viaduct. Very peaceful.Def stop off if passing by but wouldn't go out of your way to visit.Knaresborough town centre is fairly limited. Couple of interesting shops inc the site of England's oldest chemist/pharmacy (1720).Realistically you're only going to spend 30mins to an hour here."
"Breathtaking views of the river"
"Well worth the climb up the stairs in the hill to the castle for the view of the bridge and the river - fantastic "
"Interesting with lovely views"
"This is free to visit. There are information board dotted around to tell you about the castle. There's some open space so kids can run about and walkways for everyone, including wheelchair users, to be able to see the beautiful views of the gorge below. There are some nice flowerbeds - the smell of the hyacinths when we were there was divine!"
"Great show of flowers at this time of year"
"Commanding a view over the River, this is a popular place for walkers albeit well hidden from casual eyes.  Worth the effort of finding for the views over the valley and at this time of year, the effort and love devoted to the gardens is self-evident.Pause, take a seat - and within 5 minutes someone will come up and start to chat to you  It's just how they are ya see, none of this not talking when down South.Plenty of coffee shops to chose from within a short walk this is a small oasis of peace in today's bustling lives."
"A lovely setting"
"High above the valley, great views, full of flowers, historic and pretty. Information boards are very useful."
"Small but great views"
"The remnants of the castle sit in a small park next to the town centre  and museum . Great views of the river and viaduct but only need five minutes or so to walk around the site"
"Beautiful day."
"We stopped of here on the final day of our travels before we headed home. Its a beautiful town and the Castle has fantastic views over the river and surrounding countryside. There are information boards along the path ways giving the history of the castle and a museum which we sadly didnt have the time to visit. Well worth a visit if your in the area."
"Silence is golden!"
"What a delightful setting this Castle is in. I walked through the entrance and was mesmerised by the silence. It's a lovely place with fantastic views of the river with the weir and a church and bridge in the background. Loved it and could have sat their all day. Well looked after. Flower back was stunning"
"historic little town"
"We were visiting Harrogate and decided to visit this nearby town , lots of history , the castle was interesting  mainly for its old courthouse , lovely views of the river and rowing boats for hire near a riverside pub , nice few hours spent on a sunny day."
"Beautiful castle and surrounding area"
"We live in York so are used to paying for everything, so it was lovely to be able to visit the castle for free! The surrounding area was beautiful and a part of Knaresborough we've never been to, but we are definitely planning to return!"
"Fantastic view of the town"
"This destination is well worth the trip. The view from the castle grounds is very picturesque. The Castle grounds are well kept and the spring show of flowers just cap off the experience."
"Lovely setting"
"Covered in spring bulbs it was a lovely spot to stroll in mid March sunshine. There are plenty of gentle walks near and around it, but be warned the steps from the gorge below are not for the infirm or unsteady on their feet"
"Knaresborough Castle (Knaresborough Harrogate)"
"Come across the castle while taking a walk through Knaresborough while staying a couple of nights in the town. There's not much left to look at, but the grounds are well kept and it gives you a good idea of the size and area that it took up and how it would of dominated the landscape in its day."
"View from the Castle"
"You can visit the castle anytime of year as the grounds are open to the public and are free. The views from the walls are lovely looking down towards the river. There are plenty of benches as well so if the weather is fine an idea place to take a break.There is a pay & display car park just outside the gate with public toilets as well."
"Good views"
"Not a lot left of the castle, grounds are lovely to walk round and well maintained. Plenty of seating. Good views of the river Nidd with a spectacular railway bridge."
"Transported back to Medieval times"
"We were traveling from Harrogate down South and stopped at this castle on the way. It was a short walk from the open car park area where we parked our car. We would need to walk past some shops before reaching the castle ground (it was free to enter the castle grounds).The weather was good when we were there, with the Sun shining despite the chilling Winter temperature. Once we were on the castle ground, it was a pleasant feeling. It was very nice to soak up all the history, enjoying the view from the castle ground looking down a river. It all felt like a scene right out from a movie, picturesque.  Would definitely recommend to stop if it happen to be along your route."
"Views"
"Not much left of the castle, you can still get some sort of idea as to how it was back in the day. The views are stunning across the river and up towards Bilton Hall. Nice walks. "
"Lovely to see"
"I will probably go back when it's open to the public in the summer, but this makes for a lovely weekend stroll."
"Ruined Castle"
"Walk through the castle and surrounding garden and you will be able to enjoy a great view of old Knaresborough including the river and railway viaduct.  Walk down the (fairly steep) paths to the river and there are some cafes and shops amongst the old houses."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Interesting little ruins of the castle, nice gardens to walk around, we went to early in the year as the museum was closed till spring."
"Stunning views "
"Come and see for yourself. Amazing views and a lovely walk. If you haven't been, put it on your list"
"Lovely views from castle"
"Quite a long walk up steps to the castle and maybe the castle itself doesnt warrant such effort to get too? However the views from up their are wonderful and it is a great photo opportunity. Caslte itself is quite small and is largely ruins. "
"Well kept"
"After a long climb up the steps, you reach the Castle - well worth the effort as the views are stunning on three sides of the River Nidd. The castle is mainly a ruin and well kept. A stroll from the centre of Knaresborough..."
"Rainy walk"
"Knaresborough is beautiful anyway, but the castle grounds have great views and a lovely place to picnic. Sadly was raining when we visited (it was February!) but will be even lovelier in the summer. "
"Historical walk"
"A nice place for a walk around, especially in the summer, with lots of flowers in the well tended gardens. Walks lead down the gorge to go down by the river. Plenty of parking nearby although it can get busy. You can also picnic where there are plenty of benches to sit on. There is also miniature golf with a pitch and putt for the kids and the Courthouse Museum is located in the Castle grounds too."
"Best views in Yorkshire and free to walk in the grounds"
"Plenty of seating to watch the view over the Nidd Gorge with trains passing over the viaduct. Free of charge and only a 'stones throw' from the town centre"
"Amazing place full of happy childhood memories"
"The medieval fair is very interesting when it is on in the grounds but the castle is a great place to visit at any time. One can have a nice walk, play games with children and admire the stunning views available. I have gone there with my family since I was a small child and we still like it"
"Stunning biews"
"Knaresborough castle sits overlooking the valley and river with the gorgeous railway viaduct there too. The castle keep wasn't open when we were there but you could walk around the grounds and see the incredible views. There is a museum there too which also wasn't open but it was late on a Sunday when we visited so not too surprising really. "
"Unexpected find"
"I hadn't heard of this castle. Went to Knaresborough because of the beautiful viaduct and because it's on the journey to York from Harrogate. The castle is a unique find. Also be sure to check out Mother Shipton's Cave!"
"Brilliant!"
"Loved this place. Had a good wander around reading all the information and taking in all the amazing views."
"Picturesque"
"Beautiful views of the viaduct and town nestling on the hillside from the cattle.  There is a walk down from the castle along the riverside with many interesting buildings along the way."
"Beautiful  gardens  and views  "
"A beautiful  and well kept spot. Great for views over Knaresborough  River Nidd and bridge. Can be entered from town  or a hike from down  by the river ..either way just as beautiful  "
"Oustanding"
"Great place to visit. You have outstanding views of the river and railway bridge, one of the most photographed shots in the town. Good to visit at different times of the year as the seasons and sun make it a vary different view."
"""Good Views"""
"Unfortunately, not much is left of the castle after it was demolished by the Parliamentarians, I think but the views of the river below and the trainline are well worth the visit.  Some nice streets in Knaresborough. Unfortunately the museum and Courthouse was closed until March."
"Nice ruins, well worth a visit if you like castles."
"We have visited the castle twice the ruins are nice but the view over the river is well worth the look.In the summer monthe there is a musium open  worth a look."
"Stunning views from here"
"I have been to visit this castle many times whilst visiting Knaresborough and its a great place to take the dogs, though they have to be on a lead.The views at the top looking down at the viaduct are fantastic for photographers, painters and sight seers. The ruins must have one of the nicest views in the country. From the castle you can walk down to the river where there are some cafes you can sit in and watch the world go by.From the castle it is very close to the centre of town so its a good place to get away from the shops. In the summer it is a lovely place to have a picnic.I have visited the castle and gone down into the dungeons on a previous visit and also visited the courtroom museum. There are always events going on throughout the year for families to visit that brings the history of the castle back to life.If you are visiting Knaresborough I would put it on your to do list."
"Lovely views from castle"
"The actual castle keep and museum are only open in the summer, but you can walk around the yard at any time for free. There are several interesting interpretation boards to read and a lovely view over the Nidd gorge. In summer there is a putting green and bowls. From here you can walk down to the riverside or go across to the Bebra Gardens. In summer the flowerbeds are very colourful."
"Super viewsof Knaresborough"
"Walk up to the castle for panoramic views of the viaduct, river Nidd and the town.  We went to the castle having walked by the riverside and into town on a bracing January day to blow away the cobwebs.  The gardens where the ruins are are pretty too and would be a great spot for a picnic in the summer.  Walking back into town there are plenty of nice cafes to grab a bite to eat if the weather isn't so good.  There is parking nearby for those less able to manage the incline from the river walk you can get there without using steps by walking a longer way round but either way you need to be reasonably fit."
"Lovely, peaceful and on top of a sublime view"
"Very idyllic and picturesque. Stumbled across the castle while searching for the river. Very peaceful. "
"Great historical interest!"
"Lovely walk around the ruins of the castle with plenty of great fries below nice relaxed atmosphere and beautiful on a sunny day."
"Short holiday in area"
"Visited Knaresborough for a few hours. The views from the castle are stunning. The walk down to the river side is very steep so good walking shoes are recommended. "
"Visit to a beautiful peaceful place"
"The views from the castle are fantastic and well worth a visit at any time of the year. Lovely to sit a while and watch the world go by."
"Great views over the river and the bridge"
"We visited today. It was a really cold morning and not very busy. The museum was closed until Easter. It was a nice pleasant walk around and a perfect place to view the river nidd and railway bridge over the river. We  walked down to the river and stopped at a cafe to warm up. We would have walked around for longer if the weather had been warmer and the museum was open"
"Not much remains but views"
"The Castle is largely gone with only the keep and a few outer walls remainingFree to walk around and lookGreat place to get views of the river old town and rail bridge"
"Scenic escapism"
"This is the remains of a castle which is well worth a visit. You can climb the steps from the riverside or access it from town if you have physical restrictions. There is no access into the castle itself, which to be honest is small and the size of a single turret but the information provided about it's history and why is what destroyed in part is accessible from public notices in the grounds. The grounds are dog friendly too, which is a bonus."
"Good walk, amazing views"
"If you don't mind walking up steep step and if you like to touch a bit of history, you will enjoy visiting this place. Good walk, lovely views. Worth every step."
"Free activity"
"Lovely preserved piece of history, we were there when the ravens were on site, you can pay to go inside or admire the views and the flower beds outside, we have also visited the castle museum."
"Great views down to the river falls"
"What a great town to walk around with good quality tea shops and Not High Prices suggest a drive to lower knaresborough and take a walk on the river side or park at the castle yard and if you can make it !! walk down the steep steps to the river side and enjoy a cup of tea at the river side cafes"
"A pleasant wintery walk "
"A crisp afternoon over the new year weekend. A sharp chill in the air so where better to walk than atop a hill with view across Knaesborough and surrounding amongst the remaining charms of the castleOn a winters day it's not a long pleasure but it's a small moment of calm in a barmy world"
"Stunning Views"
"Great walks can be found down by the river and close to the castle. Offers wonderful view of train viaduct and Waterside activities. "
"Stunning view"
"Worth a visit , the view is fantastic . The museum was not open but was well worth going for the scenery."
"Amazing View"
"We walked up to the castle which is free if you want to just go into the grounds.There are some of the outer walls left and you can walk around the edge where you will find wonderful views out over the river.There are a lot of benches so you can relax and take in the view so worth visiting at any time of year.There is parking just outside if you can't manage the walk and public toilets which were open out of season at the entrance."
"Stunning "
"A must see if you are In the area. Parking isn't easy but there is a park and ride close by. The view is fantastic from the castle. "
"Lovely castle"
"While we were looking around this beautiful area we came across Knaresborough  Castle , it is so lovely and to see all the lovely colours of the flowers and well worth a visit ."
"Visited yesterday after the Christmas market"
"We walked back to the car park via the castle, great views of the river and surrounding area, seen the ravens, a steep walk down to the river with steps."
"Beautiful setting."
"Really enjoyed the walk on the ground of the castle. Great views of the river and lower part of the city"
"Atmospheric"
"A lovely place to sit and watch the world go around you. Offers a gorgeous view over Knaresborough that is hard to beat! Could stay there for that view for hours. Gorgeous night views as well."
"Beautiful castle"
"Nice to good for a mooch around A lot nicer in dry weather.Beautiful viewsNice cafes around and plenty of atmosphere"
"Day out"
"Lovely day spent in Knaresborough visited the Castle ,lots to see ,beautiful views well worth a visit ."
"Lovely Autumn walk"
"The walk up to the castle through the gardens is beautiful, especially in the Autumn with the changing leaves. The views around the castle are breathtaking and we were interested to find out more about the ravens. Lovely Autumnal walk!"
"Superb views. Lovely castle ruins"
"Walked round ruins on a beautiful Autumn day. It was great. Free to walk around. Museum only open during spring and summer. Quite a few visitors considering it was so late in the year. Steps down to the river "
"Great place to visit"
"Go to the Castle and take in the views along the River Nidd through the railway viaduct.  Chat to the local people who bring tame Ravens to the courtyard.  The walk down to the river and take a good relaxing stroll."
"What a view"
"Never been to knaresborough or even heard of it's castle, what a find. The whole area around the castle is excellent. At the time of my visit Ravens where being displayed and the autumn views across the valley and viaduct were amazing."
"Beautiful Views from the Castle"
"A trip to the castle is more than worthwhile- the views are stunning of the valley below where the River Nidd flows & overlooking the picturesque houses & cottages clinging to the hillside. The castle itself is worth a look despite being a ruin but much of the original wall & some of the tower remain with information at hand to its role in centuries gone by. Falling away to the side are more gardens which from the castle presents a beautiful arboretum."
"Excellent views"
"This is a great place to take some stunning pictures of Knaresborough. The castle is now not much more than a ruin but a visit here gives you a panoramic view of the area. It's  stones's throw from the tourist office and market square and you can walk down to the river from here."
"Quick stop"
"After a walk around the lovely town of Knaresborough. We walked down to the castle. A good walk around, with fantastic views. Lovely to see Her Majesty's keeper of the Ravens, in her medieval costume. The Ravens were a nice touch and very friendly. Knaresborough castle is worth a visit, complete with its own swearing Raven Isabelle."
"What a setting! And then there are the RAVENS!"
"I used to live in Knaresborough, but on returning I am always astonished at the sheer impressive setting of the castle above the river Nidd. There always have been good gardens but in 2016 noted the following:1 Attractive planters around the lovely gardens adding further appeal.2 The display of ravens: this was an incredible appeal to children and to older people also. What an opportunity to see these marvellous birds so well looked after and lovingly cared for at such close quarters. Absolutely fascinating!"
"lovely restful pleasant and tranquil"
"Love this  place never tire of the view you can sit and look down at the viaduct you have castle ruins nearby as well as a pleasant place to just walk. you can walk down and sit by the river where (probably mostly high season) you can sit and eat at a selection of tearooms/restaurants or just have a drink. Wednesdays there is a market which is so worth seeing"
"Well worth the view"
"On our way to find the river we came across the castle. Although a ruin the views from the grounds were spectacular. We were so lucky to have a lovely sunny autumn day. Would certainly visit again if in the area."
"Great views"
"Much of the castle is a ruin. That said, the gardens are very well maintained the views over the river our the must se when you visit.There are some great circular walks round the town."
"Nice castle. "
"We have often come as a family and gone round the castle and grounds. It is exceptionally nice at this time of year. Well worth a visit. "
"Superb views"
"We happened upon the castle by accident whilst looking for somewhere to park!  How fortunate.  This is a lovely spot high on a hill overlooking the river and riverside walk to one side - on the other you can see the weir and overlooks a garden down below.  We could have walked down rather steep steps to the river and other attractions,  but being  a little disabled I didn't want to risk being stuck at the bottom!  Luckily it was a lovely autumn afternoon. In the summer there is a bowling green, also the Knaresborough War Memorial  overlooks the town.  Peaceful place to sit and have a picnic too."
"Wonderful views"
"The ruins of Knaresborough castle are marvelous in their own right but the gardens and the views down to the river, Mother Shiptons caves and across to the old mill are more than worth a visit it is such a beautiful setting. wonderful for photography fans and a lovely place just to sit and contemplate the world "
"A ittle bit of history."
"As a local visitor to Knaresborough Castle it never disappoints. The views to the viaduct and river Nidd are breath taking on a sunny day. If you feel energetic then climb the steps from the waterside. There is a museum where you can learn about the history behind the castle ruins."
"amazing view over the river"
"Travelled out on the train to spend an afternoon in the area. The views from the castle are amazing across towards the river and viaduct."
"OK but small"
"OK for a half hour visit - tour is ok and museum is quite interesting but it's not a half day job - 1 hour at most.  Priced at under £4 suppose it's reasonable value - worth killing an hour with"
"great day out"
"a great day out for all the family especially if dungeons are open, you can walk the secret passageway. the castle is interesting and great for taking photographs and seeing the river nidd. the musuem is fun for kids and you can hire crown green boules for fun also a mini golf course for kids."
"Great views of the viaduct "
"We parked in the pay and display behind the police station and it took a 2 minute walk around to the castle. The castle isn't massive but has nice grounds with stunning views down onto the river and viaduct. Not a visit that takes a lot of your time but worth a look if your in the area"
"Disappointed"
"Well just that realty disappointed, Ho don't get me wrong it's worth a visit.  Go to the museum first and buy tickets that includes entry to the castle but there is not much there. We thought you could get to the top of the castle but you can only get to the first floor. As it is very cheap IT IS worth a visit.  Regards  Steve."
"Glad we went but did not stay very long"
"We went into the castle ruins and the museum over the gardens, it was a pleasant visit but we did not stay very long. There is a path which winds down the side of the castle, if you are a wheelchair user or have a pram, this may prove a little difficult."
"A good day out"
"Nice place to visit. A keep more than a castle though. Nice views looking over the river Nidd. A nice walk along the river. Plenty of places to eat and drink"
"Great Views"
"Another climb from the Gardens brings you to the Castle and grounds, there is still quite a bit of the Castle remains and the old courthouse is a museum, which was closed when we visited. There are some fantastic views over the river Nidd up and down the gorge and of coarse the railway viaduct."
"Met up with the parents"
"Lovely grounds and castle remains. Postcard views of the river and viaduct. Autumn colour in the trees just starting to show through. "
"Ruined castle with beautiful views"
"Ruined castle with magnificent views overlooking the River Nidd and viaduct. There is parking close by and a walk down the steps along waterside is well worth it. On the other side of the castle is the courthouse museum and Bebra gardens is close by which are very secluded beautifully kept with a small childrens paddling pool"
"Lovely"
"The castle is just behind the town centre so is within easy reach. It is a very relaxing place with fabulous views over the River Nidd and the bottom part of the town. In the grounds of the Castle, there is a Bird Lady who is dressed as a Viking. She looks after some very large ravens all of which she treats like her children but is happy to tell you about them, as well as some history of the Castle. A must for anyone interested in royal/local history. "
"Lovely!"
"Brilliant views over the old town and the river. A little Henley in Yorkshire. The gardens around the castle are beautiful. Free entry. There's a paddling pool for summer use. The cafes in town are plentiful as are ice cream parlours. The town is very historic and well worth a walk around. A bit hilly so you'll need to be fit!"
"holiday"
"very nice lots of walking if you are not up to walking it maybe to much for the faint at heart.its good if you go on market day then you can do the to all in one"
"Well worth an hour or two"
"A well maintained area with superb views  overlooking the River Nidd valley The remains of the castle tower are worth a visit..The museum next to the bowling green gives a brif outline of the castle and the town of Knaresborough and is also worth a visit.Admission covers both the Keep and the museum ,however they do not open until 11a.m."
"Pleasant walk through the volunteer maintained gardens."
"The build has interesting history notes placed around the ruined castle & a well kept bowling green in amongst the courtyard.Gardens were well maintained & colourful, thanks to volunteers.The paths were quite steep, so take care with wheel/push chairs. "
"Castle views"
"Knaresborough castle is a ruin atop a hill which overlooks the River Nidd.There are surviving stone works and the courtyard is now a green park with tastefully planted trees and flowers.A great place to sit and relax and admire the scenery on a warm afternoon."
"Great views from the Castle over the River Nidd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The castle and grounds are a must when visiting Knaresborough. The views from the castle are breath taking. Best to enter from the Square then you can take the downhill path down to the river. Entertained by the Raven Lady who was having a problem catching the raven."
"Hate to Say it"
"Well there are a lot more castles that are more complete. However it is in grounds leading up from the River and has many splendid views. I am sorry to say there are many ""better"" castles but this is certainly worth an albeit short visit when in Knaresborough - itself a wonderful place top visit."
"A Great Castle"
"Went with a group of friends and had a great day, the castle is part ruin and part restored , we were there for over 4 hours as the castle is a fair size with plenty of rooms to see, it really is worth a visit .The garden is well looked after with a great water feature , they are plenty of rooms in the small castle to see, very well laid out , it seems to be a lot bigger on the inside then it looks on the outside . the views are fantastic you can see for miles . the café is very good with a good choice of food and very good value . overall a very interesting castle ."
"Views"
"Gorgeous views from the top of the hill by the castle. Quite a lot of steps to get to the top but worth it for the view. "
"Castle and Bebra Gardens - Fab Fab Fab"
"Entering the castle grounds from the town square we were presented with a magnificent view of the castle ruins set in wonderfully maintained grounds. Various paths took us down from the castle grounds to the River Nidd with some quite spectacular views of the rail viaduct spanning the river on the way. Having enjoyed the views along the river path we made our way back up to the castle. A steep climb brought  us to the Bebra Gardens reward indeed for our exertions. The gardens are lovingly maintained and have great plantings. The town of Knaresborough must take great pride in maintaining these ground and gardens and as visitors we thank them."
"Small and quient"
"A good effort and quite cheap to go in, just wish there was more, but I guess that's the ruins they have to work with, beautiful views from the castle and friendly staff :)   Doesn't take long to visit, not even an hour. "
"Small and a perfect ruin"
"We had a free tour of the underground tunnel at the castle  today, it was Harrogate districts free Heritage weekend 8-11 September , the guide was very good and the Museum was small but very informative , the view to the viaduct from here is fantastic and be sure to take your camera, worth a couple of hours of your time."
"Castle and gardens"
"It is a steep climb up if you are coming from the river but well worth it once you get to the top.  Fantastic viewing points on the way up and resting points which are well needed.The castle is in a lovely spot with beautiful gardens. We chose to not go round the castle the day we visited because there was a medieval festival going on in the grounds and too much to see. When the medieval festival is not on the grass areas are home to a bowling green and a putting green. You can then follow some steps down to Bebra gardens. Alternatively you can leave the castle and make your way into the quaint town of knaresborough "
"Ravens"
"What a marvelous time we had talking to the Raven lady, she does a wonderful job promoting Knaresborough Castle,  the birds are beautiful, they are mostly tethered when on display but are allowed free flight in the evening and during the night, they are healthy well fed birds. "
"Take the tour through the hidden passage"
"Such a historic site! Shamed that it was destroyed! Stunning views of the area. Make sure you take the tour (included in the admission) and check out the secret passage. Ask a lot of questions, you'll get some interesting answers :)The ""museum"" next door is included in the admission fee and has a few interesting historical things to see and experience. Be prepared to be yelled at the ""keepers"" for all the unwritten rules they have and you are bound to break. Overall it is worth visiting and making a family outing out of it- rain or shine! "
"In a great spot but not much left of it"
"Brilliant position and outlook over the Nidd river and viaduct. Surrounded by pleasant gardens, a good pic-nic spot or just to while away looking over the valley. Not a great deal of the building remains but it has lots of history."
"Knaresborough visit "
"Smashing to walk round the castle with views over the Nidd gorge. A delight for the camera! A short walk from Newton House hotel."
"Lovely day out"
"Had a great day at Knaresborough Castle and twin.  We were very surprised we managed to fill the whole day pretty much.We went on the tour of museum, tower and grounds and also paced these out at leisure. New had a picnic in the castle grounds which was really pretty looking out at the River Nid and the old viaduct.We spent ages in the museum.  The younger two dressing up in old clothes and playing (age 6 and 12h). The older one (age 14) on the interactive computer game.  We had a couple of games of chequers in the games room too.   The questions sheets kept the children interested a little more than normal.There was brass rubbing for those that wanted it.The volunteers were very helpful and friendly.It is a small place and I am surprised we managed to spend so long in there.Combined with a trip to a tea room and some shopping in the beautiful market town, gift shops and book store and that was the day done.   The castle was £9.50 for a family ticket so with that, a few cakes and some shopping, it was on the whole a very cheap family day out."
"Beautiful views"
"The castle ruins are lovely to walk around on a sunny day, the views of the Nidd and viaduct are fabulous, can descend the steps and walk in both directions along the riverside passing plenty of eating/ drinking and ice cream establishments. Makes a really nice day out. "
"Good medieval festival"
"Festival was good with a good mixtire of free and paid for activities. Most activities were aimed at younger children."
"Lovely town"
"This is a lovely town with a very pretty park & castle remains. The view from the castle of the viaduct river & town is lovely - fit for a jigsaw puzzle. Well worth a visit."
"Cultural and Natural"
"The castle gives an impression of cultural aspect and at the same time you can see the beautiful nature and riverAlso, many restaurants are by the river."
"lovely place in a lovely location"
"knaresborough Castle is a really beautiful place to visit and has brilliant views over knaresbough the viaduct and the riverside."
"Great Ruin and Park"
"We had a nice day out at Knaresborough Castle and Park, they had storytelling on for the kids, the Castle Ravens out on show to sit beside, though they did attack my wee dog, to be expected I suppose, having her so near to them.  But they are friendly with people, but notices up saying they may steal from you.  Nice walking through park and watching the boats down on the River Nidd."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"I gave this attraction 4 out of 5 because its not really the castle that is what grabs all the attention: it's the view. The castle holds a commanding position over the River Nidd and it's well worth the climb up the many steps to the top. Unless you want to approach it from the town itself after meandering through the quaint olde-worlde streets around the market square. Don't miss the famous castle ravens. Watch out though, they bite and they don't much care if it's you or little Johnny whose finger comes within range of their beak."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Ruined medieval castle adjacent to the centre of this small market town.Worth a visit if your in the vicinity. Mainly for the view from its elevated position overlooking the river and railway viaduct. Try a visit on a Wednesday. Its market day in the pretty main squarewhich adds a little more interest to proceedings"
"VERY BEAUTIFUL"
"Knaresborough Castle is a really beautiful place to visit as they always appear to have a varied programme of entertainment throughout most of the summer with its beautifully kept gardens and relaxing atmosphere is a perfect way to spend a few hours just to drink in the beauty which lies all around"
"Very interesting"
"Decided to go to the castle as we were visiting mother shiptons cave, quite a steep walk up to it but must say its worth the walk. You have to pay to enter but we enjoyed the castle and history. Lots of interesting things to see like the carvings in the stone the dungeon guards did. The museum was quite dissapointing as not much to see."
"A delightful place to visit"
"This was a great place to visit and although my husband is disabled and cannot walk far, the car parking and the site itself was very easy to access, the views from the ground level made it an excellent easy walk to enjoy all the views. It was free to wander around and the views were spectacular."
"Small ruins "
"Only a small amount of ruin remains but you get the feel of how it was in days gone by.  Situated at the top of the hill overlooking the river, so some very pretty views.  Unfortunately the courthouse museum was closing as we got there so missed out on that.  Nice place to sit, reflect and enjoy the view. "
"Fantastic castle tour!"
"Staff couldn't do enough for us. We were allowed to but our ticket and do the SallyPort tour, then leave for a walk around the town; and use the same ticket to come back to view the read of the castle. This was handy as if you have children, you know they can get overstimulated with too much at once.       There was a dance show going on in the central green part; which was a nice touch of entertainment.       We loved the Ravens; and the lady who looked after them obviously loves them too. We were even allowed to stroke one; which was a nice memory to take home with us.       Mind blowing historical artefacts. Interesting for kids and adults alike. We will be going back!"
"Well worth a look"
"Had a lovely amble around here-it is a credit to the town-it is kept immaculate-and the serpent benches are such a lovely touch-the memorial to the fallen soldiers is also kept here."
"Go at 12 or 2pm if you want the underground tunnel and sallyport."
"Ruined castle right next to the centre of the quirky market town of Knaresborough. It's free to wander round the old castle grounds and often the castle ravens are there. The views over the Nidd are tremendous, but it can be windy! Beatifully kept gardens, a small museum and you can do putting or crown green bowling. It costs a little to go inside the castle, where there is not much to see, but children enjoy the escape tunnel. There is a good walk down to the river and super walk along the Nidd in either direction. It's worth a half day, but a quick visit to the viewpoint is good too."
"Fabulous view across Knaresborough"
"Lovely just to sit and take in the views, Castle and Museum ~ pitch and putt golf grassed area for picnics leading to lovely gardens"
"Very nice vista "
"The Castle itself is a bit of a disappointment, however the views and walks around the town are stunning.  Highly recommend a walk around this area.  We hired a boat for an hour and it was so much fun. "
"Decided to stop in Knareborough on way home from Boroughbridge and what a wonderful surprise!"
"Walked to the castle and was greeted by the the ravens who were friendly and inquisitive, if a little keen to nip.  The the views down the river towards the viaduct was amazing, even though the sun was not out.  The walk down to the river and along the river walk was just wonderful.  "
"Fascinating details"
"We came upon the Castle almost by accident, whilst having a Sunday morning stroll around the town to make sure we saw everything there was to see before heading home.  Set within a beautiful parkland area with stunning views and well written and informative notices referring to each part of the ruins.      We thoroughly enjoyed our time there."
"Good for an afternoon visit but you can see everything pretty quickly"
"Good for an afternoon visit but you can see everything pretty quickly. Not for anyone handicapped, the steps are quite a challenge."
"Beautiful setting, not much info, ravens were the best part"
"It was a beautiful walk through some gardens up to the castle which has glorious views over the river Nidd and a lovely place to relax.There was an old married couple who dress up and take their pet ravens up to the castle which you can hold, take photos with and chat with. This was the best part by far even though one of the African ones bit my arm - it was fun explaining my bruises back home! But the couple were really funny and informative and didn't pressure you to donate (I gave a fiver anyway).The castle itself is magnificent however it didn't seem very well organised. It was cheap to get in (I think about £3.60 each) but if alone you could see the lot in about ten minutes, and only had a laminated sheet for information. An investment of a few interesting noticeboards would go a long way. You do get access to the courthouse museum across the way included in the ticket price, which you could spend much longer in. So if you're interested in local and medieval history then it is very much value for money. If you just want to climb the castle then maybe not."
"Views of the Viaduct"
"Beautiful views can be see here of the Viaduct and the river. A definite yes to see. The history of the castle is amazing and they have tame Ravens here ."
"A lovely place to visit, the weather was good"
"Clean, locals friendly, the Ravens are a bonus, especially the one that says hello. Lovely riverside walk with plenty of cafes along the way"
"history"
"Not much of this royal castle left but very interesting just the same, great place for a family picnic and a game of pitch and putt. Take a look over the castle walls and take in the view... well worth a trip with a picnic basket"
"As lovely as 30 years ago - a trip down memory lane"
"I spent lots of my summer holidays as a child in Knaresborough. The castle grounds have beautiful views, great for picnics, a stroll  or just sitting taking time to sit and ponder. The ground are compact, but very well maintained and a little oasis."
"Beautiful"
"Well worth a visit, fascinating & amazing views. We didn't pay for any additional tours but I think they are available. "
"Day Trip"
"Beautiful place to visit. Plenty of things to see and do. The river side is lovely and the walks ways are very well signposted. The viaduct is breathtaking with special views . We visited on the train from Harrogate and walked back. A lovely 4 mile walk through the nidd gauge in lovely weather. It's not a difficult walk at all. It's all on the flat, but really worth doing."
"Knaresborough great day out "
"Love it here. Great shops, fantastic scenery, nice long or short walks it's up to you, you can walk into woodland or walk by the riverside, you can stop and have a picnic or BBQ or eat in the nice cafes, you can walk around the antique shops or around the castle and look at the scenic views, you can hire a boat and paddle down the river or let the kids splash around in the free outdoor paddling pool. Perfect sunny day out."
"Enjoyable "
"Enjoyable walk around the castle grounds with great views over Knaresborough. Option to hire boules or golf clubs for a pitch and put too. "
"Lovely park with great views"
"Well worth a walk up to the castle grounds.  It's laid out more like a park now although you can go into the ruined part of the castle and there is also a museum there.  The views over the river and viaduct are stunning and there was something for everyone with pleasant walks laid out as well."
"The best views in Yorkshire."
"Don't expect a huge ruin when you visit Knaresborough Castle because you will be sorely disappointed. What you will experience however are breath taking views. From the castle grounds you can look across the viaduct and the river Nidd. Take a leisurely stroll towards the sheer faced rocks or walk along the river bank, maybe even take a rowing boat. There's plenty more to see and do in Knaresborough and a host of eateries. I loved this place from being a small child, so much so, it has been my home for the last 9 years."
"Stunning view"
"Walk through the town to the castle grounds and the view of the river and viaduct is stunning. I've been visiting since I was a small child and it has never lost the 'wow' factor. "
"Amazing Views"
"Historic castle in lovely grounds overlooking the river.  Tours available or just walk around. Pitch & putt facility. Plenty of seating to admire the views."
"Pretty setting"
"The castle is set on the hill above the river and the ground and park are lovely. If you're in Knaresborough it's worth a visit. However, it's not particularly big and not much to see so don't make a special trip for this."
"Lovely view over the river."
"We parked in Waterside car park and the steps up to the castle weren't as bad as we expected being grouped a few at a time followed by a short uphill walk before more steps, so easier than continuous steps. Beautifully kept gardens and War Memorial."
"Castle just up form Market"
"This is a nice place to visit and form here you can see the river. Not much is left of the castle but it sits on a nice vantage point from the town. From the market place grab some lunch and walk to the castle where there are plenty of seats. The castle at night is lit up and is worth visiting."
"Day out"
"There was really lovely scenery here and this lovely river passing through it. There was a lot of lovely plants etc here as well."
"Lovely views"
"Nice views of the river and viduct, lovely gardens, lots of interesting hints to explore.See the Ravens."
"Relaxing day"
"The castle grounds are kept fabulous and easy access  for prams and wheelchair  users but to get to the waterside you have to go via the town as the steps are very uneven. Also bebra gardens with the paddeling pool for small children is lovely but step to get to but worth the trouble  a lovely place all round"
"Very special place"
"A beautiful setting high on the cliff gives this ruined castle a prime location overlooking the the river and the weir waterfall with wonderful views across knaresborough"
"While your are there"
"Basically the remains of a caste with a small museum. You do get beautiful views and the surrounding town is very nice with plenty of pubs and shops. "
"Very well kept"
"Beautiful view of River Nidd - but not a lot of castle left to appreciate.Near by church Saint Johns very interesting and beautiful stain glass windows "
"Family day"
"We went along to the family day during half term. It was a lovely day. The lady in the castle was nice. We went down the escape tunnel - listen to her - it is very slippery so hold on tight! The extra activities were a little disappointing but the castle and grounds are great. Beautiful in fact."
"Excellent visit"
"We visited Knaresborough for the day and this was just one of the many local attractions, all within  short walk of the river and Town square.Lots to see, loads of interesting History."
"Lovely location and great views"
"This castle is free to visit and although there's not massive amounts of it left it's in a pretty setting with gardens, tea rooms and war memorial.The view is fantastic any time of year towards the viaduct and upriver, and the gardens are very pretty.In high season you might have trouble finding a parking space.Some of the paths are level but some are steep / with steps down to the riverside so be aware if you're less able.On some days there is someone at the castle with mediaeval birds of prey - I'm not sure if they do demonstrations or its just a display."
"Interesting visit"
"The Castle was built 900 years ago but not a lot of it left now. It passes the time on very pleasantly to visit it as you can have a walk around the grounds at no cost and there are some lovely views across to the viaduct. For a very reasonable price of £3.40 for adults or, for us as Concessions, only £2.30, you can visit the museum with its Tudor courtroom and read a lot of information about what life was like in Knaresborough and about some of the people who lived there. You can even see the shirt Sir Henry Slingsby was wearing when he was beheaded as he supported the Royalists in the England Civil War. Included in your ticket is a visit to the King’s Tower and also a tour through the sallyport which is a secret underground tunnel to take you out of the Castle. Well, I suppose it isn’t really a secret tunnel now!"
"Not much of it left but lovely views and well kept"
"As above, has nice grass areas for picnic and a putting area. Views of the river and steps down to the river side or accessible from town."
"really interesting"
"Beautiful views. Interesting small museum. Plenty of seating to just relax and enjoy the calm. History brought alive for children in the separate building"
"Ruin"
"Castle itself is just a ruin.People visit Knaresborough for the view of the river valley and the quaint town.So the attraction is not the castle.  But the whole town experience. "
"Interesting Ruin"
"Spectacular views. Worth taking a look at the ruin and the well kept gardens. Small museum which has an entry fee. On the day we visited there was a lady dressed in Middle Ages costume showing a collection of tethered live ravens, obviously waiting for monetary donations. Frankly the birds looked rather sad and we weren't sure that they needed to be there. Other attractions included a pitch and putt course and a bowling green."
"Not much here, but great views"
"This  feels more like a public park with a castle ruin it. It does not take long to walk around, but is definitely worth doing this if you are in Knaresborough. The views are stunning."
"A very interesting visit"
"There is not a lot left of the castle, with most of it having been demolished by Cromwell’s forces, although there is the partly intact main tower. There is also a dungeon with some interesting scratchings of arrowheads and figures on the entrance, apparently carried out by bored guards! The very reasonable entrance fee also includes a guided visit to the short tunnel leading from the castle grounds to the outside of where the original walls would have been – this tunnel allowed castle defence forces to sneak out at night without being discovered. The lady conducting the tour was very knowledgeable with plenty of interesting information on the castle’s history, etc.  There is also the old courthouse building, turned into a museum, included in the fee, with a very informative selection of artefacts and posters. Overall, three visits in one and well worth the visit."
"Lovely Knaresborough, high on a hill"
"Knaresborough castle is a ruin, but it is a beautiful spot and location, and of historical interest. We often go on nice days and walk  The view of the river below is stunning, and town center offers lovely tea rooms nearby for a tea break. They use to have mini golf for the kids, but I am not sure if they still do that. You can often get tours, which is nice. "
"Interesting for the whole family"
"We wandered up here on a rainy day and had a great time looking around the grounds and gardens, then into the museum and ruins.   There are activities for kids such as medieval games and costumes to try, colouring in and puzzles to do - which was great as the adults could then browse the information in peace!"
"Wanting more"
"After visiting another place we made our way to the castle. I was slightly disappointed as I like to take photos and felt that the castle has been ruined by having wooden fences and banners added to the actual ruins, so it's hard to get a full view of the castle without these. I totally understand they are added for people's safety it's just a shame! You can have a tour of the castle but when we went they were on their lunch! Lovely views of the town and the river to."
"Why go abroad for the views?"
"My wife and I had visited before but we took friend who had not. They were rightly blown away by the views of the castle and the river and viaduct below. A bit of sun helped but it really is a magical view and not to be missed."
"Wonderful to see how the rich lived"
"A 17th century Italianate house surrounded by parkland.This is a National Trust property in partnerships with the National Portrait gallery.It's a must see"
"Even In The Rain It's A Must-See!"
"We recently stayed in Harrogate and had a look at Knaresborough. Sadly the first visit was on a rainy day but the Castle saved our bacon! Terrific views out over the river and the town, dominated by the impressive viaduct. The exhibits were very interesting - a fascinating insight into the local history.We were determined to have a second attempt when the weather improved a day or so later, so we stopped off again and had a pleasant lunch overlooking the river. Highly recommended if you are visiting this area."
"Historical Visit"
"Since we were staying in Harrogate, we decided to take a day trip to Knaresborough where  we were pleasantly surprised that this village had a castle. The views walking round the castle grounds were fantastic and the grounds themselves were very well kept. If only cost us £3.50 each to look round the old courthouse and castle and a tour of the old tunnel was included. great value for money."
"Beautiful!"
"Such beautiful views as it looks down on Knaresborough, the walk down the castle and along the river is lovely, be aware of the walk back, as the steps are quite steep. however I'm sure there would be another route. "
"Castle with a view."
"Free day on our coach holiday so not wanting to travel too far from Harrogate we decided on Knaresborough.Quite a long walk from our hotel (Majestic) to the bus station but we arrived in time for the no.11 bus to Knaresborough - buses nos. 10, 11, or 12 would have got us there.We passed Mother Shipton's caves on the way which are quite a walk from the town centre.Dismounting the coach in the middle of Knaresborough we made our way (after a cup of coffee in a restaurant located not far from the bus stop) to the castle which was only a short walk away.The castle is approached by two stone pillars and what would have been the drawbridge. Arriving through the gates we were greeted by the castle remains which are surrounded by very well maintained lawns and colourful flower beds.We found that the castle is not open to the public until 11am so we walked through the grounds admiring the well kept flower beds and especially the view of the old railway viaduct which lay below. Plenty of seating in the sunshine and in the shade.At 11o'clock we made our way to the visitor centre/court house museum where we could purchase tickets to look around the museum, castle and secret tunnel. A game of putting or bowls was also on offer.As it was a hot day we decided to have a game of putting first on the 18 hole pitch. Made our day when my partner and I both managed to get a 'hole in one' - fluke!We then looked around the very interesting courthouse museum followed by a tour of the castle.The castle remains consists of very worn steps leading into a chamber below and up to a tower. The guide was very informative and then she led us into the open to an underground tunnel which was used as an escape route in days gone by. Quite a slippery path through the tunnel but there is a rope rail to hold onto. We were shown spiders which live in the cold wet tunnel. The tunnel brought us out lower down at the base of the castle grounds. That was the end of an interesting tour.We walked back from the castle into the bustling old square and then had lunch in the same restaurant as before. Time then to make our way back on the bus (which runs every 7 minutes) to the hotel.It was a pleasant day spent in Knaresborough castle which I would recommend."
"Great castle"
"Went to visit my sister saw the bed race on Saturday and then went for walk on Sunday to see the castle. A band was playing and lots of people were listening. More people were walking round and admiring the views."
"Breathtaking and Stunning"
"The old Castle and Court House Museum,is well worth a visit,or you can sit and admire the view across the valley and the Old Railway Viaduct,you can walk down from the Castle to the river below and take a boat trip.Plenty of grassy areas to sit and relax and have a pinic.You can take a short stroll from the Castle into the old square and have your photo taken alongside Blind Captain Jack,who was a famous road building pioneer.Plenty of local cafes and bars to have a drink in,the buses run into Harrogate and other towns.You can visit St.Robert's Cave a 13th century hermit's grotto."
"Amazing view and surrounding area."
"Knaresborough castle is steeped in interesting history and stories, which I found out about on a recent visit. For me though, the views are the best and most interesting part of visiting this area. It was pretty quiet on my most recent visit, which added to the special feeling. I'd recommend this as one of Knaresborough's best spots!"
"Stunning"
"The views from the castle over the river are magnificent, looking over the walls toward the viaduct is a photographers dream."
"Lovely old castle remains"
"Beautiful surroundings with very dramatic cliff top views. A welcoming visitor attraction with things for all the family."
"breathtaking"
"visited on a day trip with a group of pensioners for the market. i am in a wheelchair and my brother pushed me up to the castle and grounds. they were beautiful and very well maintained. the area was quite level which made it easy for getting around. the views of the river and surrounding area were quite spectacular. i sat here for ages just admiring them."
"Top of the Town"
"Not the biggest castle, but the views from it are terrific. The museum is small, but plenty in it - very well laid out and informative. Took the steps up from the riverside, and was well worth the climb. Beautiful setting for an hour's stop."
"Awesome view of Knaresborough viaduct"
"We went to the castle with the intention to view the viaduct. The view was breathtaking. There are benches at the castle ground facing the awesome view. It is worth dropping by the castle for the view though we didn't enter the castle and its dungeon."
"Interesting old ruin with gorgeous views of the River Nidd"
"Knaresborough Castle is a ruin dating back to the 12th century (I think). There's not much left of it, but it's worth a quick stop if you're in Knaresborough anyway. The views of the castle up and down the River Nidd are the highlight for me."
"Fun"
"Spent about 2 hours around the castle and grounds with the grandkids who loved it. They're 5 and 3. You get into the ruins and the museum on the same ticket which was great as the kids wanted to do both. They loved the ravens and we're amazed when one spoke."
"Lots to see and do and fantastic view of the river"
"Knaresborough has lots of small shops and cafe's but the star of the show is behind the town centre and the castle leading to the view over the river.Take a seat beside the castle ruins--see the ravens on a weekend--but look down to the river and the magnificent viaduct. Lots of cottages on the hillside overlooking the river,occasional boutique hotel, all catering to the appeal for this beautiful vista.A gentle but careful walk down the steps, to be met by riverside cafe's offering a variety of food and drink, shops and the chance to hire a boat/punt on the river the enjoy the river in all it's many aspects.Walk along the road to the end for an english pub to enjoy it's fare or walk back into the town centre."
"Nice place to visit"
"We visited this whilst in Knaresborough. There is a lady tour guide who takes you round. The views from the top was amazing showing the viaduct.  We had a cream tea just by the entrance. We enjoyed the walk round the grounds. It's very well kept and well worth a visit. The town is very lovely too."
"Peaceful and Relaxing"
"Visited whilst on a day trip with a group of pensioners  when I wanted to see more than the shops and market. I was not disappointed with the ruins of the castle and the surrounding area. The grounds are beautifully laid out and well maintained and there are lots of seats to sit and enjoy the wonderful views of the town and river. Within the grounds ther is also the town's cenotaph which was immaculately maintained. It is also possible to play bowls and putting within this area "
"Ok for a nice stroll"
"Knaresborough is a nice place to visit with some lovely cafes.There is not much left of the castle but it is worth a visit. The views are some of the best in Yorkshire."
"Interesting "
"Not much of a castle. Just a few ruins. All the interesting stuff is fenced off..but the views are good and it is free! "
"beautiful"
"A beautiful castle overlooking the lovely river and viaduct.  The town centre Shops are all very close.  The railway station is just down the hill."
"Love Yorkshire"
"Lovely stroll around the ruins. Great photo opportunities.  Very picturesque.   Beautiful views over Knaresborough. Worth a visit. Then a lovely walk around Knaresborough. "

"Pleasant ruin with amazing views of Knaresborough  the grounds which are free are lovely to picnic in. "

"Nice day "
"Nice walk interesting history and a lovely spot for a picnic with views to enjoy and today a nice brass band playing in the sun <U+0001F600>"
"Lovely "
"Loved it here really lovely grounds and views. the whole area is lovely and somewhere we plan to visit again soon"
"Interesting"
"An interesting small activity, has various events and costumes but not too much to do for a whole day. I recommend a scenic walk after as it is beautiful in any season. "
"Nice grounds "
"A lovely castle and gardens to walk round on a sunny day. The castle is well presented and has a lot of history. When we visited it was a lovely sunny day and there is plenty of room in the grounds for a picnic  worth a visit."
"Pretty place to visit and well cared for"
"It doesn't cost anything to walk round the pretty gardens with great views of the viaduct and river.  Not too much of the castle left but still worth a visit if you're in Knareborough."
"Free"
"Another lovely walk.Park at the top if you have problems walking or start lower down for a full healthy walk "
"Fascinating view"
"The view from the cliff is definitely worth visiting this place!One of the must see in the Harrogate borough.There is a lot of space and benches to sit and enjoy the view."
"Harrogate  lovers"
"It's  a perfect spot for a nice and calm Sunday if you are passionate  about history  and nature. You can have a  nice picnic and enjoy  the view in the same time."
"Gorgeous views and stunning scenery"
"What a lovely day we had, we had a great walk around the castle grounds and around bebra gardens. The little ones had great fun hiding and running around. The views over the river are absolutely stunning. There is crown green bowling and mini golf for the older ones. We then walked down by the river and even had a little boat ride. Excellent day out for all the family."
"Fantastic Views"
"There isn't too much to see here. The actual castle has one main room with two smaller rooms attached, the dungeons and then the kings chamber. Admission also cover the courthouse museum which again is not very big. the views over Knaresborough are fantastic. We combined this with a visit to Mother Shipton's cave and both can be done in a day. It is a mostly outdoor attraction so if the weather is bad then it may not be the best place to visit."
"A nice ruined castle"
"Not too much left although what there is is nicely maintainedYou can actually get a lot from all the free parts although you can pay 3.40 to go round the towerThe Ravens are fun if a little scary (one went for my wife as she past but was on a liesh (Jessie perch) thank fully!Bowls, putting, cafe, history and excellent viewsA nice way to pass an hour"
"Lovely views "
"We had a walk around the castle with our children and dog. Well kept grounds and lovely views. Would visit again in the future."
"Views of and from the castle"
"Once you realize that you have to walk to the castle and follow the footpath signs to it you see how close it is from anywhere in Knaresborough. Small but well maintained it has the best views of the train viaduct over the river. Lawn bowling & putt-putt are both available on the castle grounds."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Great place to visit and stroll around. The grounds and gardens are well worth a visit and beautifully kept. Just a short stroll down some steps or slopes you can have a coffee or a bite to eat looking over the river and the victorian viaduct."
"Great views and very well kept."
"A must visit in this town, the views are fantastic and the area is very well kept. A super place to relax on a nice warm day, take a picnic!"
"Wonderful views"
"A small park round the ruins of this castle.  Plenty of benches and grass to have a picnic on.  The views of the river and viaduct are great from this vantage point. "

"Came upon Knaresborough by accident on the way to Harrogate. Avery lucky happening as the place is a little gem.The Castle is free to visit and gives brilliant views over the river and viaduct."

"Very impressed with Knaresborough a place well worthy of a visit."

"View the River Nidd"

"Castle Ruin and Royal Ravens"
"Knaresborough Castle is a 14th century ruin of a royal castle situated on a promontory overlooking the River Nidd and a Victorian railway viaduct crossing the river. Visitors (fee applies) can go into the remains of the King’s Tower, Courthouse Museum and secret tunnel. Parliament ordered the castle to be demolished in 1648. Some of the buildings in town were constructed with the usable stone.On some weekends and holidays, Igraine brings her fairly tame ravens to the castle. Igraine volunteered to be ""Her Majesty's Keeper of Castle Ravens, Knaresborough"" and wears a lovely medieval costume. During the day, the birds are on a jess (tether). If they were not, they would land on visitors and also steal items from visitors and golf balls from the bowling green/pitch and putt area. On the day of our visit, Igraine had three birds with her including the popular and famous Raven Izabella. “Izzie” has learned from visitors, a few sentences with blue words that made us laugh. Izzie also has two ASBO citations for stealing. There was also a six week old raven that could be petted. The birds live with Igraine and it is obvious that they adore her.Walking around the Castle Grounds is free.“Life in a Castle” offers hands on fun for children.Bowling Green/Pitch and Putt Area"
"Very Pleasant "
"Love Knaresborough Castle! The gardens surrounding it are always superbly tended and the views down across the river Nidd are excellent.Somewhere to go with some Fish and chips on a warm summers evening and watch the world go by!Not 2 minutes walk from the centre of Knaresborough for a spot of shopping or just ambling around or maybe even a bite to eat or a drink. All very close.The way down to the river is quite steep although there are different routes apart from the steps that wind down, all involve going up or down at some point. All the same it is worth the walk either way."
"Beautiful grounds "
"We got told to go have a walk around the castle by the information cement witch the guy in there told us it was free so we had a walk over to find out the castle it's self was not free but the gardens were so we missed out going in the castle as I think it was between £4/£6 each so we had a walk around the grounds in the sunshine witch was beautiful really does have some beautiful view .. they had some dancing on witch was nice to watch and some birds of prey witch was nice to give a stroke to .. nice for the kids to play on a warm day :) "
"Well worth a visit"
"Beautifully kept gardens  stunning views from castle over viaduct well worth money a must to go and see"
"Great place to visit steeped in history wonderful views"
"Had a great visit to Knaresborough Castle steeped in history stunning views overlooking the river very picturesque the gardens are beautifully kept really worth a visit."
"Hidden Gem on Top of a Hill?"
"Wonderful historic gem (castle) set on a hill overlooking the River and wonderful market place of Knaresborough, a quaint market town with Lots to Offer especially Mother Shiptons old cave on the other side of the river, a good place for walks and ideal for Children to learn about the 'Old Prophecy' of things past present and yet to come?"
"One of the best views in Yorkshire"
"Fantastic views down the gorge (in both directions).   We never fail o take friends who are visiting to see it.  "
"History in the sunshine."
"A lovely walk round the castle and the stunning gardens in the sun. The perfect place for relaxing in the sun. Learn about history in the castle and museum. Finish off with a walk by the river."
"Castle and grounds"
"Lovely day out and if weather is dry lovely walk round the gardens.  Very friendly staff and very informative and knowledgeable "
"A day in the sunshine."
"The view from here down to the river is stunning, lovely flower gardens and plenty of seats around to have a rest on."
"Lovely walk around the Castle"
"Knaresborgh Castle, is a really nice place to walk around with great views,I took my grandson he really enjoyed the day out.Janice"
"A beautifully kept garden with a castle as a backdrop - Brilliant"
"As we came to the end of a walk we were directed through the castle grounds. Beautiful.The view looking down on the river and across to the bridge was breath taking. The gardens were well maintained and well designed. The castle wasn't open when we arrived as we were there very early but we intend to return with our nephew in order to enjoy the interior of the castle which appears to offer so much."
"Great view"
"Interesting castle ruins right next to the town centre overlooking the river. Small entrance fee gets you access to the ruined keep, dungeon and museum. Nice walk through the castle and down to the river - free."
"Lovely walk"
"The castle is set in a lovely setting and well worth a visit.The view across to the viaduct is not only iconic but simply breath taking.The castle yard,museum and the old girls school are lovely buildings The paths and stairs go right down to the river where it makes a lovely walk.On a dry day it's a lovely place to visit"
"Beautiful"
"You get the best view of the city from here, definitely worth a visit to see the river and the castle ravens. an amazing spot!"
"Great vista"
"Arrived here on a beautiful sunny spring morning.lovely setting with a fantastic view of the viaduct and water below."
"Dramatic views"
"The views from the castle grounds are truly spectacular and the walk from the road where the bus deposits you is equally wonderful:  narrow lanes with very well-preserved buildings, gorgeous gardens accompanied by views of rowers and birds on the River Nidd.  The ruins of the castle are not overwhelming but the location and approach are what you go for (""it's the journey, not the destination!"").  Entry to the castle grounds is free, but there is a small charge for entry to the inside which was closed when we got there in the late afternoon.  We ended the afternoon with dessert and tea at the tea room across from the castle."
"Peaceful views"
"If you want a stunning view of Knaresborough you shouldn't miss this !  I like to get a take out coffee and just sit here to absorb the wonderful scenery "
"Fantastic view"
"Mostly a ruin, but well worth a visit just for the view below. An interesting insight into the past."
"The views are stunning!"
"A lovely castle  to wander around. However the best bit is the view from the grounds to the river below and the viaduct. Stunning"
"Interesting, but all parts of it should be free"
"Went here during a walk around the town. It was clean and well kept, but charging for what should be the most interesting part of  a minor attraction is not in keeping with the British way of doing things. We passed. "
"This is a place to Visit in Yorkshire"
" We come to North Yorkshire so frequently we consider Harrogate and the neighbouring small but interesting small town of Knaresborough as almost home from home.  The Castle is something else... it is high on our list of attractions to savour when in God's County; The North Ridings.  Be sure to give yourself plenty time to do this area justice. A prospective day out for families with children."
"Amazing views"
"Worth a visit just for the views. Great little castle, doesn't take long to have a look around but children will love it."
"Superb site."
"Going round the castle will not take long but you can visit the remains of the keep, go into a dungeon and the guide will tell you of the castle's history.  Walk around the perimeter and sense what a magnificent site was chosen.  Knaresborough museum is within the grounds as is an underground passageway (not always accessible).It is only a 100 metres to Knresborough Market centre with shops and eateries. A camera would be useful."
"Quick Visit"
"Free, spectacular views and well maintained. Doesn't take long to see so I would make sure you have other things planned for the day too."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Definitely worth the climb up Gallon Steps for the views alone. Interesting chat with the keeper of the Castle Ravens."
"goood views for photos"
"good views from the grounds to take photos of the river nidd, knaresborough, the viaduct and trains, and into the distance "
"Great view to enjoy"
"So we went to Knaresborough and we had to go to Knaresborough Castle too. First we went to the Mother Shipton's Cave and The Petrifying Well. The viet thoward the castle was awesome. We walked all the way up, passing the Holly trinity church. We ware so lucky to have the great weather that day! My attention was taken by the tiled circle next to the East gate entrance- ""Knaresborough Castle Through The Ages"". When passing the gates one can see very clean and green garden, that is definitely taken care of. Nice benches to sit down and enjoy time with precious family and friends. Possibly everyone will say, that the greatest thing there is, the view one can see from the castle - River Nidd and the Viaduct crossing it. The Viaduct looks great, when going under it, in Mother Shipton's park, but even better from the Knaresborough Castle, especially, when train is crossing it. I don't like to travel to cold places in winter, but the view from the Knaresborough Castle, I can bet, when everything is covered in snow looks magnificent! I might go there again."
"Breathtaking views"
"We visited on an extremely wind day and it was very cold on this rocky promontory overlooking the river.  Great views though.  Superb explanatory boards and very friendly staff. "
"Lovely"
"Fabulous view from the castle down to the river. The castle is well maintained and definitely worth a visit. "
"Pleasant surprise"
"The castle is in the centre of the town with great views of the river.The castle has a couple of ravens which was fascinating .The town itself is very nice with good shopping and loads of food options."
"Lovely views over Knaresborough"
"I took an evening stroll around the grounds, it was a lovely walk.  The gardens are well kept and everything seemed well maintained. The views over the river and surrounding countryside are beautiful, even in twilight."
"What a view!"
"As local residents we love to visit the castle, normally as part of a dog wall along Abbey rd. Well worth a visit, even if just for the view!"
"Spectaculer (even in the rain)"
"Although not much remains of the castle itself the remaining grounds are accessible from Knaresborough town. Very good views along the Nidd Valley and river running deep in the valley below. Boards give very good interpretation of site and area. Can imagine parking would be an issue when busy."
"Great"
"Worth a visit, great walks and beautiful grounds. Market days are really good.  Local bus service from Harrogate is only six pounds."
"Just looked round from the outside but beautiful. "
"We only walked round the outside but the history is very apparent. The view from the castle over the river valley and the viaduct is exceptional. The gardens a wonderfully manicured and close to the car park making it ideal for both the elder generation and young children that like to be carried. "
"Interesting Ruin with Great Views"
"An interesting little ruin with the old Courthouse nearby.  Well kept ground and great views down onto the river.  Also gives good views of the town which clings to the rock face"
"Not much to see but great views"
"It's a superb walk up to the castle. There's not much to see when you get there and you have to pay to get into the museum and keep. But the views down onto the river and the town are excellent. If you are in Knaresborough, don't miss the castle."
"Fabulous views"
"The grounds of the castle ruins are free and a lovely place to walk or picnic. The area is much smaller than we expected and there are very few ruins of the castle walls left.Go to the far edges though and the views of the train viaduct, river and town are spectacular. You can also see the rain approaching if you are unlucky as we were !!!A lovely little town with an excellent Wednesday market selling all sorts. No big named shops which makes a change and quaint streets to stroll with many, many eating places of all levels. Something to suit everyone.Will return"
"Historic architecture"
"Absolutely historic lovely this picturesque castle was first built in the 1100s and was extended in the 1300s absolutely lovley"
"Beautiful Knaresborough"
"I first went to Knaresborough in 1968 when I was a young 15 year old. The place was enchanting even for me at that age. Now it seems to have changed very little and is still a lovely place to visit"
"Best day!!!!!"
"A very great day out a lovely time great value for money done an Easter egg hunt and looked around although rainy great day."
"Interesting castle ruins"
"Spent an hour or so reading the history and exploring the knaresborough castle ruins. As it was Easter there was also crafts and Easter trail fact sheet for the kids to do. Lovely views and interesting facts. Fair price. Would recommend a visit."
"Great history"
"The Castle is a ruin but is steeped in history. Did not have time to tour the castle as we enjoyed the riverside walks. Good tip is to try and get a parking space up beside the castle then you a have a short stroll into the village square for a nice cuppa and retail therapy. The 2 traditional sweet shops were great."
"Walk around the grounds"
"We had a walk around the grounds we didn't go it as it was £3.40 for adults and not much cheqper for children and there wasn't much to see."
"Nice little castle"
"Not on the big size but worth a visit if your in the area. Nice views by the river with plenty of cafes around."
"top of the town"
"its quite a hike to get there but the views are fantasticwell worth the triplovely little village with a street market on Wednesdays "
"The view down to the river is absolutely not to be missed"
"I love this old ruined castle set in immaculately kept gardens with the incomparable views down to the river.  It's a good place to sit on a sunny day and just take it all in."
"Lovely"
"Definately take the time to wander around the grounds of this castle, great views of the city, well maintained grounds."
"Quiet View"
"On a good dry day this is a great place to go to and just sit and enjoy the view. The view over the river is breath taking and spectacular. Yet only a few mins walk from there you are in the heart of Knaresborough. "
"Beautiful bulbs!"
"A lovely walk in the Sun, stunning spring floral display. There were interesting characters in the area, even birds of prey on display."
"High Agenda"
"Like most Castles, this one is high in the town, so, with the added bonus of pleasant views across this pictorial town.The grounds are free to enter, and ideal for a picnic on nice days, with a small Cafe on site too.The Raven lady was there on my visit too.I do seem to remember a small charge to enter the remaining actual Castle. But the Grounds are free to amble.Now those views!! Fantastic. They will keep you transfixed for some time on a nice day. Looking across the boated river, along with the railway Viaduct. This is a beautiful location."
"Beautiful views"
"Castle ruins in a tranquil area which gives beautiful views of the viaduct and down the river. Nice spot for an ice cream or a picnic."
"More Ruins rather than a Castle"
"Bit disappointed with my visit to Knaresborough but beautiful gardens and walk down by the river saved the day!  Lots of steps so maybe not suitable for those with limited abilities."
"Great views"
"Good place to take a walk for views of the countryside and river. If you wish you can take the steps down from the castle to the river."
"The best view of all"
"It is what it is, a castle ruin, a large open space for playing, a nice market square close by, but one that comes with one of the best views you could ask for and lovely walks along the river front/cafés. We come here all the time with the kids in the summer. There are steep steps down to the river, but this can be eliminated with a longer circular walk"
"Winter Warmer"
"Very well kept grounds, plenty of seats to linger a while. spectacular views looking down towards rail viaduct. Cannot comment on museum, it was not open. Bear in mind part walls and towers only."
"lovely visit on a nice day"
"After climbing the HILL, we visited the castle,free entry. lovely kept grounds, plenty of seating, & the views of surrounding area and river were amazing. Would have been nice to climb to the top for a viewing point, but I suppose health & safety won't allow it.was lovely to see the lady in period costume with the raven."
"Beautiful"
"I was here earlier today and the views are absolutely stunning. There are plenty of places to sit back relax and take it all in."
"Great views!"
"Lovely place to wander about. Great that its free! Lovely views over the river and the viaduct. Lots of steps though so be aware it might nit be suitable for people with mobility problems. Interesting garden walk back into town through the Berba garden. "
"Gorgeous grounds to stroll around with stunning views over the river and viaduct"
"Even in February the castle is beautiful. Such stunning views and gardens, and a walk down to the lovely riverside."
"A day out in the rain"
"We were lost to what to do on a rainy day so took the train from Harrogate to Knaresborough to see the castle.  It was quite interesting but would be better on a dry day. The gardens would have looked better too. "
"Nice views"
"We visited Knaresborough Castle on a dry cold day. We found a good spot to park (a square behind some shops) and not sure which way to go, we asked locals to assist. Turned out we were only a 3 minute walk away. The grounds are lovely and well maintained. The cenotaph was well presented too. The museum was closed and there was scaffolding up. We walked the grounds, enjoyed an amazing view of the river and viaduct (complete with train passing on it) then eventually wandered down the (steep) steps for a riverside walk. All in all, nice to see for up to an hour."
"Stunning"
"We decided to access the castle from the river up the steep steps, for those that cannot climb, it can be accessed more easily from the high street and is accessible for wheelchairs.  Although the museum is closed in the Winter the information boards were more than adequate.  The castle ruins are small but very interesting and the surrounding gardens are well maintained, the views across the Nidd Gorge are fantastic, particularly the railway viaduct.  There is also a great walk along the river Nidd and an array of lovely riverside cafes. Boat hire is also available. This is a great day out in Knaresborough."
"Steep walk up but worth it."
"Visited on a cold but bright day in March, great views of the river and viaduct,Castle building undergoing some renovation currently so a bit of scaffolding around but does not really spoil the experience.Gardens have been planted with spring colour which looks lovely"
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Great view of the river from the castle, very little of the castle left standing. The town is lovely. We had a tea & cakes at a little tea shop which was excellent"
"Returning from York"
"What fantastic views both my husband and I enjoyed . The walk from the castle ruins to the river is scenic and enjoyable. Both my husband and I will update recommend it . "
"Great views"
"Lovely place to go to for nice views down to the river.Great photos taken and nice and close to many pubs which was needed as the weather was cold and wet"
"Lovely place to go! "
"Great place to go views are fantastic. Great day out ! Even in Febuary unfortunately the museum is closed this time of year but would visit again."
"Amazing Views"
"Just visited Knaresborough again and walked up from the river to the castle.  It is such a lovely place and the views are amazing.  So peaceful too.  Could sit for hours. very relaxing.  A must to see. "
"Halloween Visit"
"We visited Knaresborough during half term week. It is an interesting place that is full of history and places to explore. There were lots of Halloween decorations about adding to the atmosphere of the place. Lots of good views to be had from the castle. I am sure we will visit again. "
"Last stop on way home to Sheffield."
"Castle demands excellent views across the town & situated within a 5 minute walk from the centre of town. Not much left of the castle & not sure if access is available into the little that is left standing. Ok if passing through but little in the way of something to see much better if carrying on down to the riverside where the walk is most enjoyable.  "
"Great views from this hidden gem!"
"Having been to Knaresborough several times I had never visited the castle. So glad that I did eventually did this as the view from this point is absolutely stunning!"
"One of my favourite places to visit!"
"Great views from the castle and grounds all year round. It is very picturesque and wonderful to walk up and down the Gallon Steps and along the Waterside and loop through the gardens and castle grounds and the market place and High Street!  "
"What a view"
"Really enjoyed wandering round the castle and looking out at the railway bridge view.Only requires short visit"
"Amazing views and a lovely space in a nice village"
"One of our often places for a visit. The kids get to be knights and run around and we get a lovely walk too. Good parking and a nice village to walk around too."
"An ever changing view"
"One of the best views in Yorkshire always lots to look at in all seasons night or day the reflection of the viaduct in the river is superb lots of benches to sit on to admire the view and enjoy a take away coffee"
"Excellent views"
"This was a quick visit due to the rather inclement weather but the views were excellent of the river and viaduct. For the more energetic there are steps down to the road near the river. "
"Historical and amazing view."
"Fantastic historical site.  Good information boards and fantastic view...  Excellent car park adjacent castle fo park and go look at the shops. "
"Great day out"
"Despite it being a bitterly cold day, it was still a fun day out for all. Lovely views from the castle and great walks down by the river"
"Free to viit and handy for Town Centre"
"There is not a lot of the castle left but there are some good views of the surrounding area and it was peaceful when I visited."
"As old as the Tower of London"
"Packed with history small and compact ruin of a long lost  proud castle put that together with lovely view over the river Nidd and Bridge and this makes a excellent visit"
"Sunning locatioin overlooking the Nidd Gorge in this great North Yorkshire town."
"Knaresborough Castle commands a stunning location overlooking the Nidd Gorge in this great North Yorkshire town. Knaresborough is often by passed for its more opulent and glamourous neighbour Harrogate. But that would be an opportunity lost as the town of Knaresborough is a genuine ancient market town well worth a visit."
"New Year walk!"
"Always a lovely place to wander around at any time of year. A lady with her raven Charlie, is often in the gardens on a weekend and loves to have a chat. Tours can be arranged too and the local guides are enthusiastic and knowledgable. Fantastic view from the castle over the River Nidd and it's viaduct, should be on every visitors list!"
"Nice place"
"Hmm whaooò... lovly piece of the word, really old place...the hystory is com back in your feeling, if you walk here..."
"Nice grounds, castle a little dissapointing"
"Great views and a pleasant walk, the grounds are very nice. It's worth a visit, but don't expect great things from the castle itself. "
"wonderful place to sit and watch the world , ever changing but beautiful any time of the year, one of my top ten places"
"plenty of cheap parking and toilets near by , children and adults alike will love visiting over and over again"
"A bit wet for a visit"
"Scheduled trip on my coach trip. You make the best of the weather. Despite the rain enjoyed an hour round the castle. Great river views down to the river and railway viaduct "
"winter still worth seeing"
"Although the museum is shut for winter it is still worth looking at the castle.Nice park and benches to relax on nice day with lovely view over gorge and viaduct.Incidentally if you look at dusk as I did at present you get a lovely view of houselights etc in the gorge and surrounding areas."
"View from Knaresborough Castle"
"If you're ever lucky enough to visit Knaresborough, check out the view from the castle down to the River Nidd below. I haven't seen much in my life to match it.TripAdvisor only lets you date your trip for the last few months for some reason. This photo was taken in September 2014."
"Relaxing space"
"Great space just to chill and relax and admire the views. Lots of space to sit and watch the world go by. Lots of seating and great view of the viaduct."
"Lovely views"
"Pleasant visit when in knaresbrough, lots of parking around, we visited when the chrisymas market was on which was very nice"
"Historic"
"Make Knaresborough Castle part of a general Knaresborough visit --- the gardens are lovely and the views stunning but there isn't much of the castle left and the museum is quaint but won't take up too much of your time.  I think there is a charge to go up to the top of what is left of the castle.If the weather is good sitting in the gardens, overlooking the railway viaduct, eating a picnic, is definitely to be recommended!Sometimes there is a lady there with tame ravens to amuse the children.The walk from the Castle down to the river is also to be recommended - although walking back may not be so much fuin."
"Lovely day out"
"Love visiting here, beautiful place all year round. Visit the castle, chat to the ravens if they are tethered there then down to the moat ruins and explore Bebra Gardens (paddling pool for the children in the summer) then down the steep steps to the riverside for a lovely stroll, ice cream and perhaps a stint on the rowing boats. Lovely day out for the family. Good market on a Wednesday which is adjacent to the castle "
"Incredible views"
"A climb up or a climb down, incredible views !  If you manage to have a tour, ask about the underground escape route and you may be taken through it.  ITs not a massive castle, but has masses of personality.  What stories it must hide"
"Iconic View"
"I've never actually been inside the castle remains, but visit it everytime I go to Knaresborough, which is often. It's a great piece of history, and when it's quiet and misty, it has a splendid atmosphere. Access is level from the town itself, and it's a lovely place to eat lunch, while drinking in one of Yorkshire's most iconic views."
"A view with room"
"Having tried to visit a number of other castles in Yorkshire over the last few days in made a pleasant change to actually to find this 1 open ! We accessed the castle grounds from the river which some people may find a bit of a challenge, 200 + steps but the view was worth it. For those seeking less of a challenge then an easier route is available from the market square, the view is just as good <U+0001F609> "
"amazing view"
"It was nice to go somewhere and not have an entrance fee.  The castle overlooked part of the river.  Worth the climb "
"Well worth a visit"
"Knaresborough is a lovely day trip easily accessible via train from Harrogate or York. Enjoyed a quiet walk along the river following a 5-10 minute walk down from the station, then returned to higher ground and ambled around the castle for a couple of hours. The grounds are well maintained and the views are amazing. Topped off this excursion by a hearty lunch in the village, really enjoyed the day!"
"Lovely castle ruins on top of a hill with brilliant views"
"The castle sits on top of a very steep hill, you can walk up a steep path from the river up to the castle, or take the easy route and access it from the high street with no hills !The ruins are set around lovely gardens and it's well worth a visit especially for the view."
"""Lovely Castle"""
"Excellent castle ruins overlooking the river, very scenic and adds atmosphere to the area. Good area for a stroll and or a picnic with the family. Within easy access of local parking and quaint little shops. "
"What a view!"
"The best place in Knaresborough to get a fantastic  view (on a clear day) of the river and the aqueduct. Lovely area and great ruins (for a ruin!) The walk down to the river is a little steep but great for showing friends around who are visiting. We always take them here as a must!"
"Great views, interesting"
"Castle grounds free to walk around. Breath taking views over Knaresborough and river. Kids can have a run around, often events held."
"A very enjoyable stroll through history"
"These are ruins, but highly evocative of the past. It is a very romantic and peaceful site and perfect for a wander! It is lovely to explore, but be aware that if you decide to walk down to the river, which is beautiful and relaxing, it can be tough on the legs going back up, if you take the wrong path! Look out for the gentler slope to take you back."
"Lovely view"
"The castle itself is disappointing and there is not much to see. However, the view of the town is lovely so worth a visit. There is a car park next to the castle and the charges are very reasonable."
"Well worth a visit whilst in the area!"
"We were staying in Follifoot which was about a 10 minute drive out. We were looking for places we could have a little walk as it was such a lovely autumnal morning. Knaresborough couldn't have been a better find for us. A lovely walk around the castle grounds then down to walk along the river - a perfect Sunday morning. The views are simply stunning and the fresh air certainly did us the world of good! It wasn't heaving with people either which is nice. Knaresborough itself has a few little shops and pubs too. I'm glad we stumbled upon this and would certainly recommend."
"Amazing Views "
"Knaresborough Castle has some absolutely stunning views from the top. It was recommended to us by the landlord of the cottage we were staying at during our visit and I'm extremely glad we took his advice"
"Fine Views along the Gorge."
"Unfortunately it was quite misty but you could still see the river below with its weir and railway bridge, oh for a summers day!  The Castle obviously is a ruin apart from the courthouse and museum.(open in summer) The fact that 8 gardeners were stilltidying up the grounds and flower beds shows the care that goes into looking after the grounds, with its footpaths, steps and ramps that eventually take you down to the River Nidd where you can hire rowing boats (in summer!) Quite a nice walk in the mist, with information boards at every change of direction or waymark. There are Public toilets by the entrance. A must walk in summer."
"Fabulous "
"Didn't actually go into the ruins because they were closed on the day, but the view over the viaduct and river is one of the best views I've ever seen.Lovely lady with the castle ravens.Nice walk down to the river.."
"Beautiful surroundings "
"If you come expecting a 'castle', you will be disappointed. (I'm from Nottingham and our 'Castle' has been stripped leaving behind the great Hall and some stone - this is just ruins and view)For those that have visited Durham castle, you will notice the similar geographical layout with the River running beside the 'Castle'. Look over the wall and down to the stunning scenery, and, take in a walk"
"Nice visit"
"Thought we would call in Knaresborough and pleased to find the castleSet in a lovely gardens area with fantastic view over the riverLovely ruins of the castle of interests and lovely walks"
"Disappointed"
"The castle it self was a little disappointing. However, the riverside walk was great - beautiful scenery along with the opportunity to row on the river. Plenty of places to eat."
"Stunning views"
"Most interesting visit with stunning views, well worth the walk up from the river Nidd.Nice day out for history buffs."
"Great location"
"Walking around the castle area you can see great views of the river & railway bridge. Definitely worth a visit, good car parking also"
"What a View"
"Lovely to stand and gaze at the views, they are really breathtaking. just to stand & stare at the bridge, river and surroundings."
"Gorgeous"
"Absolutely lovely, pretty gardens with stunning views with ancient castle ruins. Visit Knaresborough!!! It is fabby. Any queries ask."
"Beautiful spot"
"Went with friends to have afternoon tea in the Market Place.  Managed to park nearby and find our way there.  I hadn't been to Knaresborough for many years and completely forgot just how lovely it is at the top where the castle is.  Plenty of benches to sit on, plenty of people doing their own thing and enjoying themselves.  Quiet with magnificent views of the river and parts of knaresborough.  Roll on our next visit."
"'Castle' is an exaggeration"
"Still calling it a 'castle' surely violates the Trade Descriptions Act.  Castle ruins would be more accurate and while the views are quite breathtaking especially on a clear, fine day, the routes can be quite a traipse unless you are accustomed to a lot of walking.   There are a lot better and more easily accessible places to visit around the area.  Knaresborough can also be a challenge to drive through with some bizarre 'priorities'.."
"Castle Ruin in Lovely Garden"
"The views across the Nidd gorge and of the railway viaduct are stunning.  The gardens around the castle are immaginative and well tended."
"Scenic"
"There is beautiful scenery at knaresborough. Nice walks along the river. The steps from the castle to the river are a bit harsh if ur mobility isn't to good but there are car parks at the top and the bottom. Some of the shops are quaint and interesting to look around. There are cafes at the shops and the river. There is a nice cafe on the river with seating along u can watch people boating or have a go yourself, the staff were very friendly and cared about how they can help u. They accommodate to food allergies without problem. U see the trains going across the viaduct above. They have a walk way back up to the shops without using the stairs. The food was lovely. "
"Beautiful walk."
"Not too much is left of the castle, but the views are wonderful.  Located in the center of town, it makes a great addition to any walk about the town.  You can see it in an hour, and then go have some lunch!"
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Knaresborough is a nice town, and a trip on the river is realy great. The castle though there is very little left to see."
"Stunning Views"
"Beautiful section of a castle ruin with amazing views. Boards to help you understand the original layout. Lovely seating on a beautiful day. No entrance charges."
"beauty spot."
"Lovely place.   Sad to say, it was foggy the morning we passed by and stopped off for a walk around.  The views would be fantastic looking down to the river.  Plenty of seats to sit and look out  also.  Would love to see it on a fine day, will have to go back some day. The town is nice too."
"Great views down to Knaresborough and beyond"
"Lovely and peaceful and the lady that takes care of the Ravens that guard the castle is so interesting to talk with. "
"Lovely ruin, with beautiful views over the river and viaduct"
"A ruined castle, but it's a lovely place and has superb views over the river and the railway viaduct.  Benches to sit and enjoy the views and a Town Cryer arrived whilst we were there and called out the local news, with lots of laughs/jokes.  Also there were three ravens, but they were shackled and I just don't like seeing birds like that, especially as one of them was desperately trying to get away.  "
"One of the better ""municipalised"" ancient ruins in a commanding & spectacular location"
"Just a short easy stroll from the town square, you cannot fail to be impressed by its location and the view towards the railway viaduct which is a feat of 19th century civil engineering is truly beautiful."
"Perfect spot "
"Castle was interesting to see. Well kept grounds. Saw some tours going by so you must be able to do that. But it was a decent little castle. The best though was the views from the castle of the river and the viaduct. Absolutely beautiful!!! "
"Great viewpoint.."
"An excellent position from which to view the river below and the railway viaduct. Don't miss the cheeky ravens."
"View to die for"
"Set in peaceful, attractive gardens, this (sadly ruined) fortification is a spectacularreminder of Knaresborough's violent past.  There is an amazing view over the riverfar below and the railway viaduct  -  a view to die for. I viewed it from outside - not sureif one is allowed inside.  Brilliant!"
"Our town history"
"Have lived in Knaresborough 30 years and still enjoy walking around the castle area and grounds. Well kept and very popular for tourists.Lovely walks around river area and gardens , plus lots of places to eat by the river under the castle grounds."
"A super 90 minute place to visit, very close to Harrogate"
"Low cost parking, nice views, easy walks can be done in an hour and only 5 minutes drive from Harrogate. "
"One for a nice day"
"Not much left now as it was ordered destroyed in the civil war. But there is still a keep as it was used as a prison. It has commanding views over the river below inviting photos from the gardens. Ask to go in the locked secret tunnel which was used to storm the castle."
"Historic beauty"
"the grounds of the castle are very beautiful and the view across the gorge and taking in the railway viduct will really take your breath away!"
"BEAUTIFUL LOCATION"
"What a beautiful town and so lucky to have the river and the superb castle. The gardens are very well tended and despite only having a few minutes on this occasion we saw enough to make us want to return when we have more time"
"Castle walls and Ravens"
"The climb up to the castle from the riverside walk is quite strenuous if like my friend and I, have health issues.  So after a quick boost from the medication off we went.  Good excuse for kodak moments on the way up to catch the breath.  The climb is worth the effort.  The castle gardens are so well kept.  The memorial is spotless.  Today the Ravens were there and they are beautiful.  A friendly chat with their keeper made it all more special as they let you close.  The castle itself was open for visitors but we didn't partake.  This would have been one marvellous structure back in ye olde civil war times.  We never tire of the view and the peace of the gardens."
"Beautiful place "
"Beautiful views from the top of the castle. Walked from the very bottom to the top not knowing there was a car park up there haha. Good exercise <U+0001F61C> beautiful place but the castle isn't anything really looks fab from the outside but nothing on the inside. Another place you can say you have been but don't need to go back. "
"Good views"
"Not really much castle to see but great views of the valley and river. It was a very popular place on the sunny afternoon we visited in early September, very pleasant though."
"A castle, viaduct and river/canal all in one!"
"Of course only parts of the castle still exist, but it is very close to the town centre, the grounds are very spacious and provide easy walking, and the view of the viaduct and river is stupendous.  Free entry!  Combine it with a visit on market day, Wednesdays, and look out for the painted windows in the town, to commemorate the ill begotten window tax of centuries ago,"
"Beautiful views on a sunny day"
"Was surprised to find that you could wander round the castle and admire the views without having to pay an admission charge. There is a charge to visit some parts of it but we spent a pleasant hour there without spending any money. Fabulous photo opportunities."
"Knaresborough Castle - My garden with a view :)"
"I live around the corner from the Castle and consider it my garden - mainly because I don't have a garden and the fact that someone cuts the lawns for me makes it even better! On a summers day sitting and watching the tourists makes me realise how fortunate I am.Not to be missed is the Museum and Castle, even though I live here I make it a point to go yearly and make sure I do the ""escape tunnel"" guided tour too!The Castle is so well kept, the flowers beautiful and how many places have a view that takes your breath away. Make sure you go to the back and sit and watch the sun set over the viaduct.And if you see a red head reading a book with a smug content smile? Well that's me...."
"Interesting castle"
"Knaresborough Castle is worth a detour for the views if the river beneath and the Ravens in the courtyard, the secret passages are also intriguing !"
"Lovely spot"
"Lovely place for a walk, be it summer or winter. Also worth walking from the castle, down through the gardens and to the riverside. "
"Fun for all"
"Knaresborough Castle is excelent. The views are breath taking. Kids had fun climbing the stairs, seeing the dungeon and going in the underground tunnel. Very resonably priced. A great outing for the family"
"Stunning"
"Stunning scenery. Bit steep. Worth a visit. Tranquillity location. Cheap parking. Location convenient."
"What a view"
"Can't believe that in years of visiting Knaresborough we have never been here before.  The views are outstanding, there is bowling and putting and, of course, the castle.  We were with the dog so didn't go in, but the views from the grounds made the trip more than worth it.  No entry fee for grounds and car park was exceptional value at £1 for two hours.  Very close to the market place too."
"Worth the climb"
"Worth a visit just for the view, it's not an easy walk quite steep, but not that far and plenty of coffee shops on the way. Give you a good photo opportunity of the railway bridge, the castle itself is ""ok"""
"Pleasant Walk with Stunning River View"
"Walking up to the castle yard from the town, very pleasant surrounding and beautiful river view. Walking down to the river bank and enjoyed the peaceful and calming atmosphere. Walking back up to admire some historic buildings. Just love it!"
"Relaxing day"
"Parked the car and walked to the castle, large grounds with a fantastic view of the river and devils bridge, interesting in the castle historical and surprised the Queen still owns it, 3 tame Ravens on view with one flying about."
"Stunning views"
"Stunning scenery with great history. Very cheap price if you wanted to go inside and view the castle however it is just as beautiful to explore the grounds which overlook the river. "
"Much imagination"
"Great views from the castle walls and a compact  museum. You'll have to use much imagination as little remains of the castle. Worth visiting but only if you're seeing other things or having coffee, etc in the very cute town centre. "
"family day out"
"A super day , will definitely visit again . River boating was a lovely experience.  The gardens had a paddling pool so next time I will take appropriate attire !!!  We ate at the Worlds End ,good sandwich.  The boys enjoyed the history of the castle and the boating."
"Beautiful Castle and a gorgeous little town"
"We went to Knaresborough Castle actually not expecting much, as we'd read online that it's a ruin. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount to see. You could wander around the Castle grounds and take in the spectacular views without even paying admission. If you want to look inside parts of the Castle, including the dungeons and a secret underground passage, there is a small admission fee (not much in our opinion) which is well worth the money.  Parking outside the Castle is not free but only £1 for up to 2 hours. There isn't a café on site, but there is a small shop. There are plenty of eateries close-by. Breathtaking views down to the river and a lovely area to walk around. The tour-guides are very informative if you like your history too!"
"The best"
"It's worth the visit and it's wonderful in all seasons! Plenty of places to get coffee, beer and food. We can't wait to go again! Lots of lovely walks and the views from the castle is wonderful!"
"Well worth a visit"
"Visited Knaresborough Castle and well worth the walk for the views alone. The museum didn't open until 11am - late for a weekend in August but we stayed to visit.Ticket included the history of the castle and then the same ticket allowed you enter the other part of the castle to view the Kings Chamber and other rooms. Disappointed that the walk through the underground tunnel didn't need a ticket to be purchased as we assumed that the price of entry to the museum  included this. There was a small putting area and bowls - fee payable."
"Awful. "
"3pm on a bank holiday weekend. . Price gives you access to the museum across the way where again dissapointment awaited.. tours of the castle tunnel finished at 2pm (included in price) although we were not told this when paying.. bowls and putting green available but also closed as it's ""too late"". Waste of time and money. "
"Excellent views"
"Knaresborough is a lovely old town that I have visited quite a few times and the castle is well worth a visit for its views down to the river Nedd and the viaduct. The climb from the water side to the the castle is MEGGA steep so my suggestion would be to park in the riverside car park and then walk along the path along the Nedd  until you come to the road. Turn right up the road following the town centre signs. Have a wander around the town centre  and then visit the castle which is a ruin but with delightful gardens and views over the Nedd . You could then do the mammoth walk down through gardens  back down to the riverside  but it is steep !!!"
"Great views."
"Well kept ruins and grounds with great views of the Nidd valley. Worth the climb from the riverside."
"It'll be nice when they finish building it - haha"
"Castle ruins - great history with lots of informative plaques around the site. Very tidy gardens. Elevated position gives superb views over the Nidd."
"Knaresborough attraction"
"A fantastic view from the castle and very interesting historically. You can still pick out the moat. In many ways rivals Richmond castle N. Yorks. Well worth a visit and the town has many interesting little shops,"
"Beautiful"
"Always a pleasure to visit Knaresborough - scenic with lots of cafe shops boat rides etc etc well worth a trip."
"Castle ruins worth a visit"
"Lovely place to visit and pay the small fee to go down the sally port and up the Tower. Beautiful views across the river and the bridge"
"Views and Ravens"
"A few steps away from the busy High Street the Castle is an oasis of calm and offers breathtaking views over the river and the railway viaduct. A pair of Ravens added amusment."
"Beautiful with stunning views! "
"The title says it all, take a walk around the castle grounds and take in the beautiful views of the river.  Close by is the square with blind jacks pub and the oldest pharmacy in England.  "
"Wow"
"This is absolutely one of the most picturesque castles I have visited. This is a ""do not miss""  Situated above the River Nidd the view from the grounds is fantastic, added to the historical castle with its dungeons and its tower across the grounds is a very inserting museum with super exhibits. The original court house with its stairway down to the room where the criminals was kept is amazing.  If you don't visit Knaresborough you will miss a great day of beauty and history. "
"nice"
"Such a great place for romantic walk. I love it.Very nice view on the river and old viaduct. In summertime is so green as well. "
"History and a river walk all in one"
"Fantastic view over the river Nith with a great overview of the railway bridge. Lots to see around the castle ruin and do use  the steps to walk down by the riverside, not to be missed. Lots of cafes and rowing units. "
"Superb views! "
"Ive been to various castles and whilst this isn't much of one as most was demolished years back the views are amazing and its FREE to get in! Id recommend anyone visiting the area to pay a visit and dont forget your camera!  "
"Beautiful Views"
"Lovely walk and not far from the town centre.  Lovely views over Mother Shiptons Cave from the castle."
"Beautiful countryside in a scenario of centuries ago"
"Beautiful place for a stroll. The ruins of the castle built nearly 800 years by the river form a beautiful landscape.You can be walking through the castle garden or along the banks of the river and even rent a rowboat to enjoy the bridges of the nineteenth century crossing the river supported by majestic stone arches."
"Ideal place to see the best view of Knarsborough"
"Nicely kept grounds with lovely view over the River Nidd with much of the original castle still standing."
"Holiday"
"We have visited before and the views are beautiful. My parent who are no longer with us visited Knaresborough and Old Mother Shipleys. As we are getting married next year we bought our wedding ring in Knaresborough."
"Visit on a good summers day"
"Lovely well maintained village so a must to go to the castle. grounds very pretty and really well maintained with good views of the surrounding area."
"Excellent views"
"Well worth the climb to the top of the steps for a fantastic view of the river and viaduct. Plenty of seating to sit and take in the view and lots of information boards detailing its history."
"Great views!"
"We went here last weekend and were blessed with beautiful sunshine for our visit. You can walk round the castle ruins for free, although a few quid gets you access to the inside rooms and the dungeon as well as the museum. There were ravens on show while we were there which held a lot of fascination for adults and children alike. The views of the river and bridge are fantastic from here, and you can easily walk down through the gardens to enjoy a river walk. In nearby Bebra gardens there is a paddling pool for the children. Recommended for a visit, views and a walk"
"Free"
"This is beautifully kept, child and pet friendly, offers some stunning views across the town and the weir on the River Nidd. We were lucky enough to meet the Ravens too. Great place to sit, eat and chill out on the lovely trimmed lawns. Flowers adorn the ruins which just blew us away seeing as most ruins you pay a fortune to see, for far less and they seem to be very neglected. This is a must do for anyone visiting Knaresborough!"
"Go in summer to see the Ravens."
"A very cheap day out if you go for a good old walk around the town and riverside. It is worth paying for the tour of the Castle and tunnel if you've never been. Kids will love the nearby paddling pool and river boats."
"History that's Free"
"I was surprised just how accessible the castle is, it's right in the centre of town with a pay and display car park next to it that's very reasonable.The castle itself is free and had stunning views of the viaduct and river as well as some history, don't expect a fully intact castle it is a ruin but not on the size that you see driving along the roads you can walk round it and it has small gardensThe castle is dog friendly and well worth a visit if your in the town  "
"Knaresborough Castle - fantastic views!!"
"We went to the quaint town of Knaresborough and were impressed by the ruins of the castle and the terrific views of the river.  What a great way to spend  a July day - hiking along the river or taking a canoe ride under the viaduct.  Do yourself a favor when you visit Ripon or Harrogate - and make the short drive over to Knaresborough - you won't regret it.Bert & Sue T.CT, USA"
"Beautiful Views"
"Knaresborough Castle is a great place to spend an hour. You can walk round the ruins and the views of the river and railway viaduct are magnificent. Gardens are well tended and there are large areas of lawn to sit and picnic on.  Parking (pay and display) is next door. There are cafes, pubs and an ice cream shop within about 1 min walk from the castle. 3 mins walk away is Knaresborough centre. Walk down the hill to the river where you can hire a rowing boat. "
"Breathtaking view"
"Great view but the castle unfortunately is in ruins and you are not allowed to enter the remains. The view is stunning though. "
"Important castle at its height"
"Knaresborough Castle was one of the most important English castles in mediaeval history, hosting King John of Magna Carta fame, and being the favourite home of Queen Philippa who married Edward The Third. Sadly, it was almost destroyed during the Civil War with only the Kings Tower and Courtrooms being allowed to survive.Both of these buildings are open to the public at a reasonable charge, but do check the opening times before going, it is seasonal, and don't expect it to open bang on time - we had to wait about ten to fifteen minutes for it to open.The tower, although quite small, is interesting, and the small museum built into the courtrooms is very informative with a few excellent exhibits.It is also clear why the castle was built where it is, because the views from the castle grounds, which are free to visit, are simply stunning.So summing up, it is well worth a visit if you are interested in history, and are visiting Knaresbrough. It is not the best castle in England. but certainly not the worst.By the way, if you want to eat well at lunchtime in Knaresbrough, good restaurants are very thin on the ground, we never found one; but there are plenty of cafes serving quick food."
"Beautiful setting."
"The castle is more of a ruin but not dissapointing. The views are breathtaking though especially on a summer's day. Well worth a visit."
"Well worth standing at the top and viewing the river"
"You would not even dream of coming to Yorkshire and missing this delight. A really beautiful part of Yorkshire."
"Worth a visit"
"Great view from the castle really nice place to visit, not loads to do but worth a half day visit, disliked the weather.  "
"Medieval castle and courthouse museum plus many spiders in the secret siege tunnel."
"We cycled to Knaresborough from Ripon along the cycle network 67 then 636 which as a relatively undemanding route well away from the traffic. After pushing the bikes up the steep hill to the castle entrance once in Knaresborough, we were met with a well-kept castle ground open to the public for free. This give you access to the splendid vista down to the River Nidd and across the wooded areas on the other side. Payment is only required for the museum and the castle.You can visit these in either order but I’d suggest the museum first so you get a handle on the history before seeing what remain of the castle. We did the castle first and there is no history detailed there, just an entrance room, a spiral stone staircase to the open level above and the dungeon area below.The museum is well worth the visit as it explains the history and is a comprehensive summary of the history of Knaresborough from the Middle Ages. Included in the ticket is a quick tour down a secret siege tunnel that was used to secretly get in and out of the castle during hostilities. The tunnel is now home to a colony of European Cave Spider. My arachnophobic daughter was pleased to be warned by the guide so she could make a quick exit.It’s just a couple of hundred yards to the market square where you’ll be spoilt for choice for something to eat."
"Beautiful views"
"Worth a visit if only for the grounds and views of the town, river and viaduct. Easy to find and Knaresborough is a delightful small town in a picturesque setting."
"Wow"
"What a beautiful village. We were lucky to visit on market day,so first a stroll through the market and shops. We stopped to here the Town Cryer read his speech,then a walk to the castle were we passed the Ravens. The view was amazing the walk down the steps and along the river beautiful a day to remember"
"Great photo opportunities"
"This castle is ruined but is very pretty with wonderful gardens and flower displays. The views of the river and the bridge is breathtakingly. Watching the rowing boats is relaxing. Easy parking. "
"Nice Place to Visit"
"Still one of the best spots to visit when in Knaresborough, the castle grounds are pleasant if small to walk around and the views down the river Nidd are probably the most photographed views in Knaresborough, please be aware that there are lots and lots of steps if you want to go down to the river from the castle, might I suggest that you drive down to the small car park at the castle end of Waterside, this is accessed down Gracious Street and turn right just before the bridge."
"Beautiful views"
"The castle and grounds were very peaceful. There were Morris dancers performing while we were there. The museum is very interesting, and the views overlooking the river were beautiful. Well worth a visit."
"Worth a Visit"
"We came across this place a couple of years ago when we were early heading back to the airport, what a find!! The views from the castle are amazing. If you get a good day you can walk, boat, paddle, swim. Beautiful town and lovely little shops and tea rooms"
"A castle with a view"
"This is a fantastic setting for a castle. Set high above the river with a view of the viaduct, the castle grounds are lovely and very restful. Lots of seats mean that there's plenty of space to sit and enjoy the views or watch the games lawns. There are walks around the castle, which is largely ruined, and the grounds themselves are free. The entrance fee applies to the remains of the keep and the old courthouse. This houses a tudor courtroom as well as a display of the history of the town, castle and local celebrities. It's all perfectly interesting and well presented."
"A free view with birds too"
"Most people visit the castle for the view of the viaduct and the Nidd Gorge - we were no exceptions. The bonus for the visit was some fun with the ravens, who are now tied up because one of them misbehaved!"
"Good fun"
"Lovely staff, who helped us choose what was suitable for our family to do - nearly all of it. Played putting, bowls, viewed the castle and the museum. Couldn't get the kids to dress up though. Great value."
"Beautiful"
"A gorgeous castle and grounds, definitely worth a visit. We also took a walk along the river, breathtaking."
"Amazing Views"
"Well worth the visit, remarkable view over the river and some interesting rooms but beware the pigeons in the great hall, 'er indoors told me it is lucky if they poop on you, so I bought an extra lottery ticket!"
"Taffs"
"Very well maintained. Well worth a visit and then stroll down to the river for a cuppa. Lovely!  Quite a lot of steps so may not be suitable for less mobile visitors. "
"Beautiful grounds"
"The gardens around the castle are well kept and very beautiful perfect to sit in or have a picnic very well looked after."
"knaresborough river"
"rowing down the river was just wonderful peaceful . the cafes at the side of the river were very nice."
"Stunning views !"
"First visit to knaresborough , bought some lunch at a local shop and  a local  suggested the castle grounds for a picnic ( thank you ) .Views spectacular down the river and across the valley . Gardens lovely and very well maintained , not a scrap of litter to be seen .Unfortunately it began to rain and there are not many places to shelter ,so we packed up and decided to look around the castle and museum. Not very disabled / young child  friendly, lots of steps both into the museum and inside the castle ruins . However very interesting artefacts and the guides were very helpful and friendly.Lots of young school children on outings who were very well behaved and enjoying the dressing up and games on display .If you could manage the steep spiral and very well worn steps in the castle ruins the views were worth the climb even on a rainy day .Would return on a nicer day just for the views ."
"Ruin in the middle of the town"
"I have known this place for the larger part of my life so it seems a bit odd writing a review for it.There is precious little of the castle left, Cromwell or his boy's blew it up and the local builders did the rest - re-using the fallen masonry in the local houses. The site does have some terrific views, and when the sally port is open - using that tunnel is a worthwhile experience. Is it worth a special trip - probably not. if you are in Knaresborough, and gave a few minutes to spend then you should go "
"lovely place"
"beautiful gardens and picturesque great place for a picnic with stunning views this is  a well kept and clean place  - the facilities are great and good public toiletsnice little coffee shops are scattered throughout  - just lovely place a much for a visit  "
"Superb setting"
"This is the height of understatement, with the main car park being part of the castle. The well tended gardens, the immediate proximity to the town, and the spectacular views over the river Nidd make this a stunningly attractive location. Keep and museum are small but interesting, but this attraction is the heart of Knaresborough."
"Knaresborough castle"
"Best to go on a tour  and down through the Sally port. Brilliant to fire children's imaginations, dressing up and activity room in the museum is well used if small and the museum itself has lots of fascinating information. "
"lovely setting...."
"Price includes entry to the castle & museum. Both small but definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Museum has some interesting artefacts, castle 'just remains' interesting but both have steep steps so definitely not wheelchair/pram/pushchair accessible. My son carried the baby but had to leave pram unattended outside museum - able to leave it with staff inside the castle. Staff friendly but beware.....we were locked inside & my son had to climb a railing & go to museum to alert a member of staff who came 'very apologetic' to let us out!!!!"
"Such wonderful views and walks"
"For a pile of ruins, this is a great place with spectacular views - river, railway bridge, town. Lots of walks from the castle to the river and the town. A must for anyone visiting the area."
"Knaresborough castle walk"
" Knaresborough castle is wonderful, it look good in all season, walk along Abbey road and do circle walk a long the river, cross over the river at the bridge through the Caravan park stopped for tea at little tea room on the river bank. carry on walking back to the castle . This one my favourite walk it flat. and easy "
"Worth a visit"
"We visited Harrogate and this is located in the vicinity.  Nicely kept and lovely views of the marvellous viaduct and river below. There is a court house to visit too.  It is situated towards the rear of the High Street which have some nice shops in the courtyard."
"love this place"
"i adore knaresborough gorgeous placelovely river setting and castle , mother shipleys cave very eerie and worth a visit but on a nice day a river boat or picnic is just as lovely my fav place."
"Worth a look if you are in the area."
"A lovely mostly ruined castle with beautiful views. If you like castles and history you will like this one...what makes it better though is its location. sat right on the river you can wander down to the riverside cafes ect after your visit and also have the time visit Mother Shiptons Cave which is a ten minute walk because that is a fab place to go. With the other attractions near by this makes the castle a good visit. Also for those with young kids there was lots of room to run around.   "
"Surprising views"
"Loved Knaresborough Castle, the views were amazing and unexpected. We spent a lovely afternoon walking through the gardens and by the river, stopping for an ice cream in the sun. Could have missed this experience if a fellow hotel guest had not pointed us in the right direction."
"A beautiful location"
"This was our second visit to Knaresborough and it did not disappoint. The market was on along with a Town Crier. The remains of the castle is just a short walk from the town and the views are stunning. On our previous visit to Knaresborough the intention was a quick look before going on to York. We did not get to York but had a very enjoyable day around the castle and along the river."
"Not to be missed"
"If every you're in Knaresborough then don't forgot to pay a visit to the castle. The view from the grounds is second to none !"
"Well worth a visit"
"A beautiful place to visit. If you're in the Harrogate area make sure to go here as in my opinion, it's much, much better."
"A castle with a view"
"The castle itself is only a ruin, but the gardens around it and the view down the Nidd Gorge are amazing"
"I never knew Knaresborough had such a history..."
"The Castle and museum is excellent value and includes a Guided Tour at certain times - well worth a visit "
"Probably the best views in Yorkshire"
"Knaresborough castle is basically a ruined castle that is exceptionally well managed by the local authority.  A large structure with some intact walls and a well preserved keep which is open for exploration at certain times.  There is also a 'secret tunnel' which can be explored when open.  Google 'Knaresborough Castle' for current opening times to see the keep and tunnel.  The rest of the castle grounds are immaculate and well worth exploring.  There is an interesting museum in the old courthouse and a bowling green.  But for me, the highlight is the view over the river valley - quite unexpected as you approach the castle from the Market Square.  As most of the castle has free access 24/7 it is well worth a visit.  Small charge for the keep & tunnel."
"only the ruins remain but wonderful views"
"It is just ruins now but it's just in a lovely spot with wonderful views all around and it's free. An easy uphill walk from the river up steps and worth the effort"
"Where the knights who murdered the Arch Bishop of Canterbury in Canterbury Cathedral excaped to!"
"Although a ruin, the castle remains & garden are ranquil and provide an excellent vantage point from which to view the river Nidd below and the iconic Knaresborough viaduct. One can park very close in the pay & display car park adjacent to castle. A worthy stop and excellent photo op."
"Dr"
"Simply the best place in the world. Why did I ever leave this town. It's much better than Liverpool where I now live. I love it. "
"worth a visit"
"lovely place to visit close to river great views and walks castle very interesting close to town centre where there are plenty of places to eat "
"If visiting Knaresborough, go for the stunning views."
"Very little of the castle remains here but the views are stunning. Well worth a visit. I usually take visitors here and they are always pleasantly surprised. Parking situated behing police station ( close to market place)."
"Good for an hour"
"Good museum of life in the castle. Castle itself is obviously a ruin but has lovely gardens and views. Only a few quid to get in so worth it for an hour or so."
"Nice view but..."
"The castle does have an outstanding view from a highpoint, but there really isn't anything else there. The village was really quiet. Parking was cheap though."
"wonderfull place for photography"
"Knaresborough is such a beautiful place when its sunny. lovely view from the castle if ya into your photography this is the place to go loads of pictures to take  . lovely river walk very clear and very romantic boat rides for couples and also good boat rides for all the family"
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Lovely. Beautiful old ruins looking over the gorgeous river. Worth a look around, loved the peaceful surrounds. The gardens were in full bloom and it was a very pretty location. Access to some parts of the castle require a small fee."
"Great views"
"Nice area to walk in parkland with access to riverside ,cafes and river activities. A steep walk around the castle, lots of steps to river but if able nice route, otherwise approach the river via the town."
"nice little town and a castle"
"worth visiting, cute little town with nice views. castle is interesting although I don't get the story with tied up ravens"
"Set in a beautiful location this is one of the finest castles in Yorkshire."
"Knaresborough Castle is a ruin of a once splendid castle. A royal castle for almost all of the last 900 years there is a lot of history here. There are two basic ways to see the castle: - the grounds are a free public park and allow you to see much of the surviving fragments of the castle ruins. You can also enjoy one of the most famous views in Yorkshire. - the castle is open daily in the summer months for a small fee. This gives you access to the ruin of the King's Tower. including a cellar and the (sadly roofless) King's Chamber once amongst the most impressive rooms of 14th century Europe. You also gain access to the Elizabethan courthouse (a rare survival) which also serves as a fine museum. If you arrive at the correct time you can go on a guided tour for no additional charge over entry. If you get this chance then make sure you don't let it pass you by, the tour includes access to a medieval sallyport (the secret tunnel kind not the postern kind). The sallyport tunnel is amongst the best in Britain and is well worth seeing. Facilities on site include golf putting (additional cost), crown-green bowls (additional cost), dressing up clothes (included in entry), board games (included), and a gift shop. Limited food & cold drinks are available. Parking is available in adjacent car park (small charge), the nearest toilets are located in the car park. Train station is 10 minutes walk and the bus station 5 minutes walk. You can access the castle from the river side via 99 steep stairs. It is worth also visiting St Robert's Cave (free), the market square (free), Mother Shipton's Cave (moderate charge) and St John's church (free) while in Knaresborough."
"Beautiful views. Great history"
"The castle is highly ruined but has lovely gardens and seating areas. Overlooking the famous mother shiptons bridge and the boats below. This is one of the most photographed views in the area. The castle is also home to the ravens which are related to those at the tower of London and kep here incase of illness in those in London."
"Nice"
"Steep walk up to the ruins but it gives you a lovely view of Knaresborough. Better than wasting money visiting the cave on the otherside of the river."
"For a ruin there was lots to see!"
"We enjoyed the castle ruins - despite the ancient uneven steps with a small but interesting area to discover. It is very reasonably priced and has a very well set out museum that we did not leave enough time for as we only took an hour's car-park time at the nearby car park believing the price to indicate a quick visit. "
"Lovely evening stroll and view"
"We've visited during the day previously but this time we dropped by in the evening to watch the sun go down The views are lovely as are the gardens.  As we'd just eaten a big meal, I couldn't persuade the family to walk down to the river and back but we enjoyed seeing the athletic ""bed racers"" who we think were practicing for a forthcoming race!  Took lots of pictures and enjoyed the views but never got to see the sunset as husband got the time wrong and we were 90 minutes early!"
"Well worth the walk up the hill"
"This isn't just ""One of the ruins that Cromwell knocked about a bit"": it looks out on one of the finest views in Yorkshire. As you walk up the hill from the river the vista expands with each step you take. The castle grounds are beautifully maintained and there is a little gem of a museum in the courthouse. It's very informative and home to a very rare Tudor Courtroom which has survived virtually intact. Sadly Cromwell did a proper job on the Keep but enough remains for you to get an idea of how things might have been. Apparently it belongs to the Duchy of Lancaster and hence The Queen. With a view like that we were surprised the Monarch doesn't spend her holidays there."
"A drive out and about "
"We didn't actually go into the castle but we walked round the grounds in my wheelchair, and the views were beautiful. "
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Castle ruins and museum worth a visit the grounds are nice and Ravens are there to look at. Lots of steps though down to the river not suitable for disabilities or wheel chairs."
"Knaresborough bed race"
"On the 2nd sat in June every year there is a bed race that starts in the castle grounds.not to be missed.about 70 beds are made up as floats.parade down the high street to Coney park.then stripped down and teams of 6 or more race round Knaresborough and across the river near coney park.plenty of food and fun.race starts a 1Be early.roads are closed ofBest day out ever.all for charity"
"What a view!"
"To be honest we didn't actually go into the castle just around the grounds but it was lovely,the views from there are fab."
"Sparse"
"There isn't much left of the castle but it has entry of History which is well portrayed. The best thing is the grounds and the fantastic view to the riverside area and rail viaduct."
"Nice Castle Ruin."
"It a great ruin, to visit. There also a cellar. Also few interest things inside and also great surarounding the castle."
"Day at the castle"
"Relaxed area with lovely views and sense of history. Good for families and plenty of parking places and nearby faciliteis. Good for all ages."
"Quick Fix"
"This area is quite small and is recommended to be visited for around half-an-hour just around the castle grounds, although the inside of the castle is particularly pleasant. "
"The perfect vista."
"Beautiful scenery, beautiful gardens and things to do e.g castle/dungeon visit, putting or Knaresborough Museum, and yummy ice cream nearby if sunny day."
"Beautiful views over the dale from castle runis"
"The castle is ruined, but the king's tower still stands tall commanding majestic views over the valley."
"Beautiful place!"
"Castle and little museum were interesting and the view down to the bridge was amazing. Lovely place to spend a lazy afternoon. Would deffo visit again."
"Beautiful"
"Breathtaking views,walking from the castle down to the water front .Lovey cafes to sit and people watch one of the nicest places we've visited."
"What a view!!!!!"
"Breathtaking view! this city is a little pearl! Was the first time in Knaresborough and we will definitely suggest it to our friends! it worth the visit! 10/10 only for this amazing landscape!"
"Breath taking views from the bridge.through the bridge"
"Have always seen this on a train and wanted to go and visit and see for myself, Lovely little historic market town and well worth the visit, beautiful scenery from down on the waterfront, delightful castle and lovely town to walk around and plenty to eat places, Well worth the visit. Sadly not long enough on our coach tour to view everything, didn't get to see Mother Shiptons Cave but that is good excuse to come back to visit"
"Beautiful grounds"
"Beautiful views and grounds. The castle is ruined so not much to see or do. There is green bowls available but it was too rainy to try out! You can walk from the castle down to the river."
"Beautiful surroundings"
"Scenery beautiful,steep walkways and steps. Alternative ways around can be found. Loved it,well maintained. Town very interesting with different types of shops. Everything in walking distance"
"Great veiws."
"Although first stop was the Castle grounds, well presented and manicured and not a drunk slouched over a park bench anywhere. So peaceful and fantastic views of the town and river valley below. Sit back and relax for an hour, as the river is calling you to explore the valley itself."
"wonderful views, the sallyport and museum are interesting"
"We went to the castle. We climbed the hill from the riverside, which is pretty hard work. We also had a walk around the village.. The castle has a tower you can climb and there's a couple of rooms but not much. The garden and views are extremely pretty, though. There's a museum which has local history, and that was interesting. we also walked through the sallyport, which is an extra charge and only done at certain times."
"Day Out"
"We took our friends to Knaresborough to show them as they hadn't been before. They were enthralled with everything, as we always are. There was a fair going on, which was very nice, and a market. We also did a walk by the river, and loved seeing the wood carvings down there. All in all a lovely day out, and we will all go back again."
".worth a visit"
"lovely well kept grounds and a great view of the riverside from above. You need to be able to use steep stairs to get down from the castle to the riverside though."
"Lovely grounds"
"Didn't enter castle itself due to time restrictions however gardens and river surrounding were beautiful and views from the castle grounds were first rate and you could happily sit and watch the world go by. Grounds and garden were well maintained with a wide variety of plants and trees. The village\town itself was also pleasant to walk around with a good variety of shops."
"GREAT VIEWS."
"Well Kept,Easy to walk too from the centre of Knaresborough, Great views across the River valley & Mother Shipton's Area.Mostly free, though seperate charge to enter the Tower & Museum."
"Great views nice grounds and ruins."
"We spent a couple of hour in Knaresborough itself then made our way to the castle the views over the river are really nice also a very high rail bridge can be seen which spans the river all can be admired from the castle grounds,the castle it self is ruins its FREE to get it the grounds and ruins but there is a charge to get in the museum which is housed it the old keep,,,the grounds are not that big there is a bowling green in there along with a small golf putting set up,,,,,its a nice place with the sun out with a ice cream or picnic to spend a few houses...plenty of children in there with mums and dads,,,is worth going just for the views....ps ice cream shop only 50 yds away(not cheap but yum yum)"
"Wonderful views"
"loved the views of the river from here and the gardens were beautiful. Went down the steps to the riverside walk and was glad that we went this way and not the reverse. I would hate to have to climb up them!!!"
"what a view"
"castle is ok for a short visit. the gardens here are great. you can walk down the hillside terraces to the river. there is a wonderful view of the river and victorian viaduct/bridge here. also a small museum worth a look . cheap nenough and worth while, village has plenty of good quality cafes and pubs! mo"
"More than a ruin with a good view"
"The castle and the grounds themselves are lovely and most of the photos you'll see of the viaduct are taken from this vantage point.  But there's more to this castle than the vista beneath it.  You may not realise it, but if you appreciate history, and just whose grounds you're in, this castle has interest beyond most. It has direct connections with Kings; Henry I, John and Edward I and II and also was the refuge of one of the assassins of Thomas Beckett.  It became part of the Duchy of Lancaster in the 1300s via John O'Gaunt (Edward III's son) and remains owned by The Duchy of Lancaster to this day.  So, whilst it may not look much now, you can thank the Civil War in the 1600s for that, this is the property of the Monarch and has been for over 700 years.So, when you wander around, sit and look out at the views, remember there's over 900 years of very interesting history around you and you're in the Queen's garden.It's more than a ruin with a good view."
"Special offer the day I went - only £1"
"There is not a lot left of this castle. but it's not totally ruined like some - the central bit (Keep?) was retained at the request of the citizens so they could use it as a prison! Great views from the top, and a food store (originally ) that became a dungeon later in the 'basement' area. About an hours worth of visiting time could be usefully  spent. Not sure how much more I'd want to pay if not on a special offer. And for those not too good on their feet, beware the steps! - staff good at reminding you of this, and the one I spoke to was very knowledgeable. "
"Beautiful views"
"This is a lovely medieval castle with beautiful gardens. There's a small charge to go inside the castle but the view and the gardens are free. "
"nice for a short walk"
"Lovely views over the river, beautiful setting to sit and have your picnic  and a short walk. Nothing for children  "
"Beautiful views"
"Walked upto the castle on a day visit to Knaresborough. Lovely views from the castle although not much to keep young children entertained.Worth a  visit for the views alone"
"Iconic viaduct shot from Castle, enough said."
"Fantastic iconic shot of the viaduct from the castle. Does anymore need to be said? Well yes, there were 'tame ravens' too. Knaresborough itself is pretty tame and obviously small but the area around the castle and the river is simply stunning."
"Bank Holiday visit to Knaresborough"
"Simply beautiful. Stunning views from the castle. Lovely walk along the River Nidd. Loads of gorgeous places to stop for a bite to eat and drink. Had the best day. Definitely visiting again soon."
"Lovely afternoom"
"visited Knaresborough on Easter Monday, weather was terrific, perfect place on a glorious day, walked along the riverside, then up to the castle, great views, beautiful gardens, picnic/play areas, had a full circle walk saw some beautiful houses/guest houses, plenty of sit down or eating places, well deserved drink sat outside one of the delightful pubs, plenty of dog walkers all welcome, tempted to go on the boats but too busy, had a look in at Mother Shipton's,  finished off with a delicious ice cream, ideal place on a lovely day"
"Beautiful village!"
"What a little treasure in Yorkshire this village is.There are stunning views from the castle, and a great walk at the side of the lake.It wouldn't be any good for someone with limited mobility as the hill down to the front is steep and with steps.Plenty of cafes line the river side. "
"Lovely views"
"Visited Knaresborough recently and came across the castle. Lovely grounds, delightful views and all that fresh Yorkshire air. Well worth a look around. Knaresborough also has lots of cafes and places for refreshments and it is cheap to park the car."
"This is England"
"Only seconds from the main town square, the view of the river Nidd from the castle is glorious. This is England."
"Great afternoon"
"Lovely well kept grounds, reasonably priced,  always helpful staff. Add fish and chips followed by a walk down by the river and an ice cream it's a perfect day out for us!"
"Idyllic"
"Surrounded by lovely views and outdoor acticities. There is a lovely view over the river with lovely walks in either direction."
"Great view"
"The castle may be a ruin but the view is stunning there is a museum a few quid to go in but we didn't vist. The town is small but worth a vist plenty of  Tea rooms and nice old pubs it's only 10 min drive from Harrogate or you can catch bus ."
"Not a lot there"
"Not much to the castle itself, but worth the walk for the views over Knaresborough. On a sunny day, can spend a whole just sitting on a bench and watching the world go by."
"Well worth a visit"
"The castle is free entry and the views of the River Nidd and viaduct are excellent.  There is easy access from the town centre, but if you approach from the river be aware of the steep climb up the 119 steps.  The castles a ruin and there is no access inside"
"Worth a look if you like old castles!"
"We wandered round the castle grounds on a cold wet day in early December, it had a certain atmosphere to it.    There is a fantastic view down into a big valley from part of the grounds....."
"What a view"
"There are a lot of steps if you come from the river walk along the Nidd but both are worth taking in. How many towns in England can offer this scenery with the impressive viaduct adding to the mix. "
"Fabulous location."
"The castle is high above the river, with views for quite a long way. It is a bit of a climb up to the castle, but well worth it. There are some gorgeous walks along the river bank."
"Lovely old place"
"Wonderful views of Nidd valley and parts of Knaresborough. Well kept grounds and interesting ruins. Lovely to find somewhere like this that is still free. Did not get chance to visit museum which sounded interesting."
"gorgeous views"
"What a beautiful place, so pretty and we felt so relaxed walking around with all the stunning views from the castle ruins! Its a must see if your in the area!"
"Old ruins"
"The remains of the castle tower above the River Nidd and are most impressive. One can only surmise what the overall structure would have looked like in days of yore and how strategically placed it must have been."
"stunning views"
"Just a small castle and you can go down in the dungeon,in summer on a Sundays they have brass band concerts,most Sundays in summer a lady in medieval dress demonstrates birds of prey.picnicis a must,then a lovely ice cream from a small shop situated across from the castle green.good afternoon out"
"Neat place to take visitors from Overseas"
"It was quiet when we got there as the place would not be fully opened until after easter. The walk around the grounds was pleasant and interesting free of costs it would appear to be more interesting in the Summer"
"Scenic Great Views."
"Knaresborough has lots of routes for walking along the river. On any routes there are up and down hills or steps and along the route are cafes/drinks for a nice relaxing day. Very good for a nice sunny day. You can get a boat and go down the river.  Gorgeous views whichever way you look.Highly recommend. Also come across old rocks, castles and many more."
"An example of our violent history"
"As well as magnificent views of the river Nidd and the Nidd valley Standing defiantly is the remains of Knaresborough castle. Thanks to Oliver Cromwell only a few walls, columns and the Keep remain (the keep was retained after the towns people asked for it to be spared for use as a prison) There is a museum in the old court house. Beautiful grounds, challenging walks, Knaresborough market place...so much to see."
"Not to miss if you visit Knaresborough!!"
"An absolutely stunning, beautiful landmark right in the heart of Knaresborough!The castle grounds are beautiful and peaceful with plenty of benches and bins. The view = breathtaking. I live in Knaresborough and the view from the castle grounds down to the viaduct never fails to blow me away. Has to be one of the best views in the UK. Definitely worth a visit. Highly recommend :)"
"History"
"Came across this castle unexceptedly. Full of history. Nice area to walk around and great views of the river and viaduct"
"First visit"
"First visit to the town, Castle ruins and the view from them were worth the stop. Lovely little town and shops and the car parks aren't a rip off! What's not to like."
"The view!"
"Hardly any castle left but def worth a stroll round. The view down over the River Nidd is stunning. We went in Feb and it was freezing but I'd still recommend it. Must be beautiful in summer. The crocuses were up and even those little blooms looked lovely. Do visit."
"That View!!"
"Entry into the castle itself, I wouldn't say was worth it! I'd only go in when it's on offer, pay no more than a pound!!However, the gardens... & that view!!! You have visit just for the view of the river Nidd & viaduct!!Activities available in summer... but the view is spectacular in any season! One of the best in Yorkshire!!"
"What a view!"
"Just wandering around Knaresborough 'Found' the castle, the signage and promotion of this wonderful site is just not good enough. I have be to Knaresborough over twenty times and had never been here it is that badly advertised.However, what a wonderful view and pleasant stroll, it reall does give you the best perspective I have had there.Love it and will look forward to revisiting on a lovely warm day for a picnic. "
"Interesting history"
"An enjoyable trip out with my 12 year old son.  Obviously there's not a massive amount of castle left to see, but the history is interesting nonetheless, with good views of the surrounding area."
"love this ruin!"
"Think this is the best ruin of a castle we have visited. The views of the valley around are lovely. In summer time a picnic and watching a game of bowls would make for a relaxing time."
"excellent presentation & situation..."
"...but not much castle! I've visited many times and today it was raining and cold. The view from anywhere in the grounds is either inviting, beautiful or stunning. I was struck by the meticulous attention to the lawns, borders & beds. The fella working was careful and clearly took pride in his job. I came to the castle from the town square so no long climb for me but down or up the effort is worthwhile. Despite half-term there were few folks about (see cold & wet) so a great place to wander and let your thoughts take flight. There are indoor sections which are open at different times of year and I've not seen them myself. I just love the setting."
"A must-see"
"Many people visit Knaresborough and don't visit the Castle; maybe they just don't know it's there. But with its grounds and the most amazing view from the cliff on which it stands down to the River Nidd, it's such a shame that it doesn't form part of everyone's itinerary. "
"Worth a look around"
"There's not much of the castle actually standing but it is still an impressive ruin.  It is also surrounded by a nice enough, low-key garden area.  The views are definitely worth the short but steep climb to the 'castle' itself (the view of the beautiful viaduct, spanning the river Nidd below, is quite special)."
"Nice place coffee by the water was lovely"
"We came here for a look around, there isn't a whole heap of things to do, we enjoyed a coffee and cake by the waterfront and watched the ducks wallying around in the sun. The food in the waterside café is rather pricey."
"Lovely location"
"Lovely location! Looking right over the river, visited here with my mother and dogs, had a afternoon tea in a close by cafe and spent the afternoon exploring the grounds"
"Superb views from this craggy vantage point."
"As castles go this is more bijou than magnificent. On a good day you will find a walk or drive to the high point where this castle is perched extremely worthwhile for the picturesque, postcard view over the river, town and bridge alone.     There is, however, quite a bit more to fill out your visit to this petite and charming town. The castle clings to a soaring rock wAy above the pretty river and town below. Attractive gardens, perfect for gentle strolling, surround it and there is a bowling green, flower beds, defensive walls for peering at the view over and a bandstand. In one direction the shops and square in the heart of the town lie conveniently just a stone's throw away. In the other direction you can follow the path along its hairpin bends down the cliff side past the paddling pool and shrubs. This will take you down to the river and the rowing and paddle boats, the waterside tearooms and the ice cream parlours,msouvenir and antique shops. A perfect using for those visitors from abroad or elsewhere around the country. Photo opportunities abound here!"
"Great view...."
"Very little to actually see in the castle remains...... but well worth the very long climb up from the river for the excellent view and photo opportunity of the viaduct and river."
"Nice walk"
"Great little jaunt. Great view of the river and valley. Worth a look.  Went in January so bit rainy. Would love to see it later in the year. In bloom. And do the steps up from the river for a work out."
"A Ruin"
"Very little of the castle to see but lovely views of the river and bridges but quite a climb up from the river walks"
"Interesting place to visit"
"Helped to make a pleasant half day in Knaresborough with an interesting guide. they keep a nice secret tunnel for you as well"
"Knaresborough Castle in November"
"It was a wet Saturday in November when we visited the ruined castle. The view from the castle is splendid. Would like to visit again in the Summer and enjoy the view once again,  and the gardens surrounding the castle."
"Great visit and views"
"Knaresborough is so worth the visit - the Castle on the hill drop is dramatic with views across the Nidd valley make it an ideal stopover for encounter to York."
"Part of our itenary on our coach trip"
"We only had a short time here, the weather was awful, so it was a quick look around, the views over the river, and the town were lovely.  Lots of small shops and a great bakery."
"Worth going to Knaresborough but not especially for castle"
"Knaresborough is well worth going to and do go to the castle mainly for the wonderful views over to the river valley and the mock mediaeval railway bridge.Do walk down the steps to the river walk with cafes available for coffee etc.Parking in Knaresborough is not easy but do persevere. There is a wonderful bakers there with an astonishing array of baked goods - a world away from the usual Greggs."
"Great views and tales to tell"
"Although the site is fairly ruinious it really is a fantastic place to visit in the town.  Great views of the valley and River Nidd.  Almost 360 view of fields and trees.  Some super areas for families to play.  Information plaques are full of interesting facts.  Still need to do the museum."
"Best view in England"
"Enjoy a visit to Knaresborough Castle with the most amazing view over the river to the viaduct. In summer you can go into the castle, under the grounds to the moat and into the castle museum. A lovely place to sit and watch the world go by in summer or winter.Then a short walk into the town centre for a wide selection of cafes and great shops."
"Best view in Yorkshire"
"The grounds and the castle in Knaresborough provide the location for the best view in Yorkshire. On a summer day, there is nowhere to match it. Take a look around the castle then sit in the gardens and watch the world go by. Sheer bliss. If you have the energy, take a boat out on the river and have a little row. That rhymes with NO not COW."
"Fantastic Views"
"Lovely walk high up looking upon River.Full of history and interesting location.Steps are steep leading down to  the river so be careful."
"Very clean and interesting"
"It's not a place that you think of when castles come to mind, but it's a very well tended and interesting place. Spent well over an hour looking it over, so there's lots to look at. It was a weekday, yet still very busy. This was a good example of civic responsibility."
"Fantastic views over the river Nidd"
"Nice castle ruins with amazing views over the River Nidd and valley. Pleasant walk around the grounds and it's free which is a massive bonus. Worth an hour of anyone's time if you are in Knaresboro"
"Knaresborough"
"Visited Knaresborough 1!6/11/14 In the evening to photograph The viaduct. It was a foggy night but did take some good photo . Will be going back."
"Picturesque"
"Very nice setting with river and castle ruins ...cafe's and restaurants are many .... recommended ... beautiful back drop from castle over river and commanding views"
"Pleasant spot"
"Spectacular views over the river, ruins had reasonable information boards.Visiting it will not occupy too much of your time viewing though."
"History with a view"
"Went with relatives and explored the castle remains.  They have done quite well presenting what is left of the castle, with information about its history and connections available.  The view from the castle across the green, and the Nidd with the railway viaduct is beautifully scenic."
"If you like a bit of history and a view to die for......"
"Knaresborough - what a lovely place.  The castle isn't totally intact and a look around doesn't take all that long.  It's setting is wonderful.  perched on the top of a crag looking over the river Nidd it presents a view to die for.  Looking down over the river, the train viaduct spanning it, with the backdrop of the church and field and trees beyond is just wonderful and worth making the visit for in itself.  There is also putting and crown green bowling to be had in the castlegrounds, a paddling pool in the gardens beyond the moat.  and of course the wonderful historic town of Knaresborough to mooch around too with its market place containing the oldest chemist shop in England and a weekly market each Wednesday.  A grand day out."
"Great afternoon out"
"Lovely town and castle, well worth having a look if in the area! Very pictureque and with a bit of sun its a perfect photo oppertunity"
"this is a must visit"
"knaresborough is a great day out .good fishing on the river great boting good pubs,nice shops this place has everything for a great day out.the castle is a bonus you can see everything from above lots of hills but well worth a trip"
"Good budget daytrip from Harrogate"
"I was on my own and staying in Harrogate. I stumbled across this hidden gym. It was only 9 minutes by train. It's basically ruins of a beautiful castle. It is free to see. It overlooks a wonderful river with bridge. It's basically fun to wander around and walk the stairs and paths around the castle. I also saw these big, beautiful ravens. I did not go in the musuem but it probably was very interesting. My concern is that these birds were tied up and obviously did not like it. I thought that was a bit cruel and what concerned me even more is that nobody else seemed to be bothered. Overall,  it was a great day trip."
"A bit of history to walk in"
"Overlooking the River Nidd (meaning ""bright""), nice gardens to walk through, a Courthouse Museum, the view across/along the gorge to the famous railway bridge and sight of Old Mother Shipton's Cave and grounds. All of these are worth a visit, and they're all in walking distance (steep in parts though)."
"Lovely area especially for photographs"
"We have come here on a couple of occasions now to have photos of our daughter taken.  The scenery and views over Knaresborough river are fantastic.  Not much there apart from views but its nice for a 10 minute walk round"
"Fantastic views"
"Not much left of the castle and only little information about the cattle on a couple of display boards. However, the view from the castle ruins across the river Nidd and the old railway viaduct is breathtaking. "
"Raven raconteur"
"The castle and moat provided lots of interest and the view of the river Nidd and viaduct are spectacular. We met the keeper of the castle Ravens along with two talkative Ravens Isabella and Gabriel - Gabriel shouting ""What's the matter?"""
"Nice place"
"I took the bus from Harrogate to Knaresborough around 15-20 minutes. The castle is located behind the police station. It's free for visiting. I really enjoyed a beautiful location. I will go again if I have time."
"Lovely views."
"This was the second time we had visited Knaresborough Castle and although it was an Autumnal day the view was still worth seeing."
"Great Location"
"Very small but extremely impressive views over the river below, interesting historical facts on signs and a very interesting lady with trained ravens. The museum was shut but seems interesting."
"brilliant place to visit"
"loved all of it so much to see and do plus a nice café to have a cup of tea lovely views over the river ."
"Wonderful for an afternoon outing"
"Great afternoon activity the views are spectacular and the staff are amazingly helpful & full of knowledge. Not too expensive either so I would highly suggest a visit."
"Great experience but steep stairs"
"The castle is very nice to visit and it's on top of an amazing landscape, therefore the view is great and one can also go for a walk around it. It is a very interesting experience and I definitely recommend visiting it if you're in the area. The only problem was that going up and down (especially up) the stairs were steep and very old, plus the spaces there were empty so if you struggle with stairs I would recommend just staying on ground level. "
"A castle with a view"
"The castle is close to the main street of the attractive town of Knaresborough, which sits on the hilltop above the river. It is mostly a ruin, but offers great views and atmosphere. We particularly enjoyed the ravens, which are owned by the Prince of Wales apparently, but looked after by a costumed lady. And one of them can be encouraged to talk (the ravens that is)."
"Knaresborough"
"Well worth a visit. Great views over the River Nidd. Entry fee is only small for the museum in the courthouse. If you're luck you may even get the chance to see the Castle Ravens flying in the grounds."
"Knaresborough; wonderful gardens and waterway"
"Knaresborough Castle is mostly a ruin and access to the museum and tower is limited to the summer months. The museum was small but excellent; exceptionally friendly and helpful staff.The Castle ruins are set in lovely gardens; plenty of stamina is needed to explore the lower levels as gardens are on a very steep slope! Knaresborough is set within beautiful scenary and is well worth a visit"
"Beautiful spot"
"Castle was built on a beautiful spot in Karesborough.We took the  tour and it was most interesting.Need to  do it  get  full understanding of the property. "
"Lovely views"
"We visited on our way to Harrogate and the castle and grounds were very pleasant and the views over the river and bridge were stunning, the area is kept to a very high standard and cost of entry was very reasonable, the ravens were great to see and one has two ASBO's for its behaviour which we thought was quite amusing. All in all a good couple of hours to tour around and take in the sites and it was very pleasant to sit in the gardens and take in the views.Both the town and castle are worth  a visit to savour the area and small roads. Parking is good value  for the time you need we paid £1.60 for  4 hrs"
"A must see if in the area"
"We visited the castle twice this year, the second time had a delightful conversation with the keeper of the ravens, this lady is so knowledgeable and loves her ravens, Isobel, Gabriel and Morden (I think).  she had me in stitches at the antics of Isobel. Just love the place, views are fabulous and Knaresborough is a friendly lovely market town.  I will definitely be returning."
"A little bit of histoy"
"The guided tour is essential to fully appreciate it's part in history. The views are spectacular.well worth the visit when in the area."
"Best day out....."
"Beautiful old town and castle. Reasonable charge to park all day at mother shiptons cave and walk. Short trip through the woods but really lovely on a good day. There are ravens at the castle which you can get very close too as their keeper is with them. Fabulous views from the castle over the water and the town. Well worth a visit and children will enjoy it."
"Wonderful views"
"Well maintained castle ruins and surrounding grounds overlooking the River Nidd and Yorkshire countryside. There is not much car parking space close to the castle so if you are prepared for a 15 minute uphill walk it is easier to park at Mother Shipton's Cave. The castle is well worth visiting even if you are just passing through Knaresborough. It is an ideal place for a lunch break or just a comfort stop."
"Interesting, if ruined, castle!"
"Went last New Year. Although it was cold and wintery we walked with family along the Waterside river path from Bond End and took the STEEP climb up steps to the castle. Not surprisingly nothing was open (it was New Year's day after all!), but the castle grounds and marvellous views were great to see. Good descriptions of each building and its past use were strategically placed.You can also reach the castle by road either up a STEEP hill by pavement from the river or on the level from the town.A very nice and easy walk back to our Hotel through the town let us see the still visible Trompe l'oeil painted windows - fantastic! A very nice market town and well worth a visit."
"Go just for the view."
"Although it is quite a ruin , the parkland surrounding us nice with lots of flowers. Fantastic view looking down to the river and the lower part of town.Good signage explaining all the history."
"What a lovely place."
"Such a lovely place to stay. Must visit mother shiptons cave and petrifying well. Start your walk from the castle. You can have a bit to eat right by the river. It's such a pretty walk. The town is so ironised. The public bars are very thoughtful and interesting. I will defiantly visit again. Soon I hope."
"Worth a visit if you in the area."
"Knaresborough castle is a nice place to visit with its wonderful views  over the river. The town has lots of very nice shops and places to eat.  "
"Return visit."
"Only a short run from Harrogate, but a must to visit if you're in the area. Fantastic views from the castle gardens over the river & railway bridge. Nice market town to have a wander round also. Plenty of parking with toilets just a short walk from the centre."
"Great spot to view the river."
"We didn't enter the castle itself, just walked the grounds which have great views overlooking the river."
"Stunning Castle battlement views"
"Ok I'm a little bias as I am a resident of the town. I'm also a little reluctant to tell the world just how stunning the town is as I don't want the place too crowded.However, the views from the battlements looking down the Nidd river towards the Victorian railway viaduct have to be seen to be believed. With views like this staycations cannot be beaten. Hanging on to the crag are dozens of ancient houses spilling down the cliff side on to the water front. This is linked  by the meandering and cobbled 'Water bag bank' which is lined by thatched cottages which are hundreds of years old. If in North Yorkshire a must see "
"Excellent views"
"Pleasant gardens within the walls of this ruined castle. Very good views down towards Mother Shipton's cave."
"Great location, great piece of history"
"Allow a good part of the day to explore the Knaresborough Castle and other attractions, especially the Riverview in this lovely area.  I travelled their by bus from Harrogate, but the train runs into flown to.  The Riverview walk is well worth the time and there's many attractions .  A definitely must see for a beautiful part of Yorkshire.  The Viaduct bridge is a focal point.."
"interesting"
"Interesting, fabulous views down over the river and bridge.Old lady up there with some tame ravens, which was causing a lot of attention.Very good"
"Meet a Raven amonst the ruins"
"trip for family and couples explore the ruins at the top of the hill and enjoy fabulous views looking down on the river Nidd as it nestles in the valley. enjoy an ice-cream and take in the friendly atmosphere whilst see the Ravens being cared for at the top. simply a great visit as part of a day out."
"As a castle, nothing special!!!"
"Visited the site as a castle, which almost nothing left of it, be careful when going up the steps in the castle, they were not flat and slippery. Nothing much to watch. But the view from that spot was super, the keeper of the ravens was a nice add on. The museum is worth visiting, but don't expect much. "
"Dramatic backdrop for G&S Opera"
"Within the 21st ""International Gilbert & Sullivan Festival"" in Harrogate, one theater company performed the ""Yeomen of the Guard"" in Knaresborough Castle. Although not much of the original castle is left, the remaining ruin and the beautiful gardens provided a wonderful backdrop to this dramatic G&S opera that was enjoyed by a sizeable audience."
"The Knaresborough view"
"We visited Knaresborough Castle one afternoon.  Parking was close by, the usual pay and display.  We enjoyed a walk through the castle down to the river.  The sight of the railway bridge was excellent.  An enjoyable afternoon. "
"A must during your visit"
"If your a history buff you have to visit. Met a lovely lady who is the keeper of the ravens , but the view from to the river is absolutely amazing. You can walk down to the river and there are more sights to see on your way to mother shiptons. But if your packed up the top of the hill , be prepared fir a long walk up a steep hill. A beautiful area, stunning"
"Striking castle"
"This is a striking building (well ruin) in the pretty village of knaresborough.  I was distressed though to see the castle ravens tethered outside with tourists scaring them and nobody there to protect them."
"Lovely"
"A low cost couple of hours. Visit the small museum and remains of the castle - friendly staff - worth a visit. And then walk down the hill and experience the river setting, cafe and boating"
"Great - views are lovely"
"Worth a look if you are in the area. Great view over the river, and went through the sallyport - which was shorter than imagined but all very charming"
"lovely day trip to knaresborough"
"when we went to knaresborough the weather was lovely which made the day even better,during our day we went to the castle and the views from the castle are stunning,would recommend a look around the castle when you visit you will not be disappointed."
"highs and lows of Knaresborough"
"Very old castle, with ruins and nicely laid out gardens. The day I visited there was a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan to add to the interest. The walk down to the riverside is well worth it, although steep! The view from the castle is brilliant"
"Great view, excellent spot for photo over town"
"A steep climb up the hillside steps is rewarded with a fab view overlooking the river and rail bridge below. Lovely gardens, and interesting remains of castle. The outdoor areas are free to walk around but there is a charge for the castle and museum.Inside the castle you can climb one flight of very worn stairs to the first floor, but there isn't much to see. You can see it from the ground outside (by the car park) before you decide to part with cash. On the ground floor is the main room, a small side room and ""wardrobe"" / old toilet. Down below is a single prison room. Not a huge amount to look at really.Didn't venture into the museum or sally port (underground escape route) - charges applied."
"Breathtaking views"
"Although most of the castle has been lost, enough of it remains to give you a feel for what it was like when it was intact.The grounds are lovely for a walk and there is access to the river from the castle down, be warned though its not for the less mobile.The views from the castle over the river and town are spectacular, its such a lovely peaceful spot."
"Nice"
"Nice bit of history but not much to see, gardens nice, it's free and on a nice day is a lovely place to be"
"""perfect view"""
"the gardens ,the views to the viaduct and river below,chatting to the raven keeper at the castle was very intresting being able to let my son hold a raven on his arm made his day. mother shiptons cave was a lovely walk through the forest lots of wood carvings to look out for,but shade from a very hot sun.a circular walk can be done through the forest over the bridge and down by the river on return to a river side cafe for ice cream just long enough, very relaxing ,."
"Small Castle, large grounds"
"The castle is very small but you can also visit the museum just across the bowling green. There are also tours of the sally port in the summer. Times are listed on the gate or at the castle. There is plenty of room for children and toddlers to run around safely (as long as you don't let them climb the walls. There is a huge drop off some of them!) There is also a putting green and in the summer holidays they sometimes have giant chess and other games laid out. You get a fanastic view of the river and bridges from the castle walls and can walk down into Bebra Gardens where there is a paddling pool. It doesn't always have water it in but the walk is pleasant. It's buggy and wheelchair accessible but beware the walk back up is pretty steep! There is a lovely handmade ice-cream shop just outside the grounds (Brymore's on the corner) and lots of benches in the grounds to sit and eat your ice-cream and relax while the children play."
"Old ruins"
"Nice place to come and sit and revel in the Nidd valley and the lower part of Knaresborough below.  Really nice views all around and a peaceful park, well tended to relax in.  Castle is really a ruin, but has an interesting history and is owned by the Queen (cool)!!!!"
"Nice view"
"Worth visiting if in Knaresborough and a nice view of the river and railway viaduct. Close to the town too. "
"Castle views"
"Atmospheric ruin with free access to grounds. You can pay a small fee & visit the dungeons & on site Museum. Great views down into the Nidd Valley & the rail bridge. There are 8 ravens kept here - same as at the Tower of London. Go down & do the riverside walk if you are fit enough. "
"A lovely spor"
"Knaresborough is a lovely village in Yorkshire, it has a lot of history and a lovely river walk.  The castle has great views and is well worth a visit. It is located very close to the main square and you can access the river walk down the steps"
"Good views"
"Knaresborough Castle is set in a vast area. Information boards around the site give you an insight of what it would have looked like in its hayday. Steps down to the waterfront are nearby.Photo is of Knaresborough from the castle."
"Wonderful views"
"Climb up to the castle from the river or approach from town .. there are spectacular views across the River Nidd and the castle is open to visitors .. a ruin but worth seeing . The museum in the very pretty grounds is interesting if you want to know the history of the town . The grounds are beautifully kept and there are plenty of benches to sit on."
"Martyn Townsend"
"Great day out with grandkids, picnic and lots of adventures plenty to do and burnt off plenty of energy . Enjoyed running down steps to river walk"
"Smashing walk"
"A great walk around this much loved landmark, we were lucky enough to meet the raven master and also made it just in time for the official tour! "
"A great ruin"
"Most castles have a defensive vantage point, but knaresborough castle looks down a dizzying drop into the Nidd valley and is quite a sight to see. The castle follows a familiar route through history which began with the Normans and ended in demolition after being held by Royalists against Parliament. Today, the site is worth a visit. Manicured bowling and putting areas, seating enabling visitors to enjoy lovely views. There's a museum which I didn't have time to see. The access to the sally port is accessible but not all the time. Lovely spot."
"Lovely views of the river"
"Castle ruins turned into a delightful small park. Interesting museum. Great view if the river and bridge. Town worth a walk round. Found one really good antique/ collectables shop."
"Amazing View "
"There isn't much to the actual castle but the view over the river and viaduct are amazing ... Well worth a look :-) "
"Fabulous View"
"Not much left of the actual Castle but the view makes up for it.Lovely view down to the river and the viaduct.Interesting museum within the confines of the keep.Alot of seating.A sally port which is only open at certain times"
"Beautiful Town"
"My wife's ancestors hail from Knaresborough, hence, this was our second visit, with the first in 1993.The castle area has been vastly improved since then and it is now a destination worthy of a visit to hear the Brass Band on a Sunday and sit and admire the sensational views."
"Perfect views from here"
"A trip here was not part of our plan for the day but we are so glad that we popped by. The castle itself is mostly in ruin but is set in the most beautiful garden with one of the best views of the River Nidd. The history of the castle is fascinating (dating back to King John) especially seeing that this is still owned by our Royals today. The castle ruins are well researched (and the descriptions are quite humorous!) and the volunteer staff are friendly and helpful. The museum across the lawn is very informative with some interesting artefacts.There is the option of playing boules or go putting but it was a little damp to give it a go.Definitely worth visiting when coming to Knaresborough!"
"Excellent"
"The views are just lovely. Great place to walk around, play a game of putting or sit and watch the world go around.Some nice little shops, and the ice cream shop on the corner, before you go around to the castle is excellent."
"Picturesque  indeed"
"Had gone to visit UK to visit my brother who works in Leeds and we went to this beautiful town if Knaresborough and visited this castle for a day picnic and walk at the recommendation of a colleague who works nearby The quaint little town and this area was decorated to welcome the toure de France race which would be passing through it in early JulyWe visited the castle and took a long walk along the river Nidd which was breathtaking We also sat and had coffee at the shops lower down and watched the beautiful view of the bridge  and the boatingThe view from the top is breathtaking and the local train/tram running across the bridge makes for a very stunning backgroundWe had a local band playing I the afternoon and we enjoyed our picnic lunch on the grounds and icecream along river sideOverall a lovely day spent there"
"Excellent location"
"The views from the castle are stunning. We went for the Tour de France and the castle was set up as a hub to watch the race, it was fantastic for this. The price for the castle was reduced for the day which was good as after looking round if I had paid the full price of 3.30 each i would have felt it was too much. There isn't much to see in the castle and the grounds are the main attraction. Still well worth going for the view over the river. "
"Worth the effort"
"Opportunity to learn more about the place & the function of a castle in this location, & how people lived during such hard times"
"Historic treasure"
"Well kept and interesting attraction with spectacular views across Knaresborough. Lovely place to sit and take in the beautiful river and viaduct."
"Excellent view and parking close by!"
"Location: excellent with great viewsActivities: £3.30 per adult for entry to castle (ruins) and museum. Highly recommended if your first time. Games to play for the family such as mini golf and Bowles. Gardens: excellent walk around gardens for the family or pets  Advise: wear flats as lots of walking involvedRiver boat: hire a boat for an hour for £6 each adultIce cream: lots of flavours available in a small but lovely place by the river"
"Enjoyable"
"Nice, interesting afternoon wandering around the castle and grounds.  Very pretty area situated right by the river. Nice river walks"
"Views from the castle"
"this is a special place,  magnificent view from castle ground which overlooks the river Nidd.  , the viaduct, and the boats on the river,  lovely sunny day, Knaresborough town picturesque too."
"Put your flat shoes on Lucy, and start climbing!"
"Lovely place to visit. If you have the imagination, it is such a romantic place overlooking the gorge. I say put your flat shoes on, but one of the locals who lives opposite the Marigold Café, walks up and down the gorge to the castle, every day, in 4"" heels!"
"Castle"
"Visit splendid,museum and beatiful rooms full of charm .... makes you relive the times of the Tudors and the great history of the English kings"
"Views are stunning."
"Being a Yorkshire lad I've visited Knaresborough Castle many times as a young lad but now living 75 miles away for the past 34yrs it's so nice to go back too. The Castle (what's left of it ) has so much history to tell and a guided tour is available which is half a hour long. The castle stands overlooking the river Nidd and the views are just stunning from the Castle. It's such a popular view it can be found on most postcards and even jigsaws. The grounds are well kept and whilst we were there a lady had four ravens and was telling everyone all about them. It''s a MUST for any trip to Yorkshire as the town it's self is steeped in history and the market square boasts the oldest chemist in England. Mother Shiptons cave is also in Knaresborough and worth visiting, it's fascinating seeing the petrifying well and teddy bears hung up under the dripping water turned into stone. If you've never visited Knaresborough before DO NOT MISS IT - you'll be amazed and get some lovely photo's."
"The perfect day!"
"We absolutely loved our day in Knaresborough, we walked all over town, took countless photos, rented a rowboat, and were just thrilled to be there! What a lovely holiday we had, and Knaresborough was a huge part of that."
"worth a visit"
"This castle has a fantastic view. What a shame that Henry sought to tear it down. Lucky that the town folks at least got a reprieve to say what it left. The little museum is worth a look. Won't take you but half-hour to see it. Then another half-hour to ""tour"" the castle. "
"fantastic"
"Beautifully preserved fantastic views,Helpful guides. We will go again to this beautiful part of the world"
"An airy vista over the Nidd"
"Knaresborough is one of my husband's ""memory"" places and we wished to revisit after many years away, thankfully, it did not disappoint."
"My favourite place"
"I visited the castle few year ago.fell in love with the view.and moved from newcastle to harrogate last month.the view sealed the deal x"
"Charming town and stunning views"
"Don't miss an opportunity to visit here! The views from the Castle are stunning.  Take a boat on the river on a dry sunny day, it looked fun!"
"castle"
"Not a large castle but well worth a visit. Has excellent grounds and views overlooking the river.  You also have the option when at the castle to see the museum."
"Knaresborough Castle"
"I stayed with friends in Knaresborough and the castle was one of the sights on my must see list.  We wandered up and down the River Nidd, and took some great photos. There isn't much left to the castle, but learning all of the history and seeing the ruins is a moving experience.  It was nice to have a ""local"" as our very own tour guide."
"Very interesting castle :)"
"Very knowledgeable tour guide took a group of us around the castle when we visited a good few months ago and gave great amounts of detail on the history of the building - all very interesting and the building is pretty fascinating and ancient (and in ruins of course) "
"What a view!"
"The views from Knaresborough Castle are quite simply stunning. The long winding river, boating hut and viaduct paint a perfect backdrop against an enchanting castle."
"Very interesting"
"This is mostly ruins but still very interesting with a first class museum too. The views down across the river were beautiful. A visit here is a must."
"Great view from above"
"From here there's a stunning view of River Nidd below and the viaduct.  Just this is worth the climb to the castle ruins.  There's a museum in the courtyard, entry fee applies.  Nearby town high street has lots of shops for exploring, primarily run by independent shopkeepers.  They have a lot of charm."
"Beautiful views."
"Lovely little market town,coupled with fabulous views from it's castle make Knaresborough a must do if you are in the Harrogate area."
"castle ruins"
"Nice to see the ruins of this castle. Pleasant to sit in the grounds and admire the great views of the river. "
"Worth a look"
"Free is always a good start, nice to look around but didn't take long as it is ruins. Nice little garden to walk around and the view is amazing over the town, and the sun set breathtaking."
"A lovely spot"
"Only  a ruin remains of this lovely castle but the setting is lovely. Knaresborough itself is worth a visit. A cute little town with a market, independent coffee shops, restaurants and pubs.The landscaping around the castle in spring was stunning. The views to the acquaduct and river were beautiful. We were blessed with a beautiful, sunny day which helped. A cup of tea, homemade soup and a toastie at the Buttery in the car park was an economical yet tasty lunch with castle views."
"Good views but not much left of castle to see"
"Great views but not much of the castle left to see and no tours or guides to make the castle come to life. "
"free and fantastic views and in the middle of town"
"if you're in knaresborough well worth a visit. probably not worth a detour across the country for as it's small and ruined, but views over river gorge are fantastic - you can eat your fish and chips or ice creams there. the courthouse and keep are open at weekends"
"knaresborough castle"
"I love to walk to the castle grounds and take in the beautiful view, I never get tired of seeing it.  If your feeling energetic you can walk down the steps to the riverside and hire a boat for an hour. I prefer to have an ice cream and feed the ducks. there are several good cafes to have a spot of lunch or a coffee and watch the world go by. I like to sit in the beer garden at the worlds end pub they do good sandwiches and home made chunky chips, there's also a choice of lovely main meals.  across the river you'll find mother Shipton's  cave and petrifying well . there are swings for the kids and a picnic area and gift shop...."
"Impressive ruin with views"
"This is an impressive castle ruin in the equally fascinating town of Knaresborough, about 3 miles from Harrogate town centre and accessible by bus and train.Overlooking the River Nidd, the castle sits on top of a cliff. The view down across the town and river is stunning and if you travel by train from Harrogate, be prepared for the viaduct bridge crossing as you enter the station. Worth the ride just for that!"
"Best view in Knaresborough"
"Knaresborough is on of the prettiest areas in the region....the riverside walks are just stunning! A worthwhile visit for any visitor. Oh and some of the best ales ever at Blind Jacks."
"Beautiful Setting!"
"This is the perfect place to go on a sunny day with blue skies! Quiet and relaxing with an amazing view to take in. The castle is an amazing attraction to see, considering that it was built around the 12th century and still part of it stands today! Therefore, there may not be much to see of the castle itself, but it is still worth visiting!"
"Nice"
"Nice castle, unfortunately there are only a few short walls left. It's free and the parking near the castle is cheap. If you are in Knaresborough, stop for a few minutes to enjoy the views."
"Don't visit the town without calling here"
"We know most of the castle has been demolished in past centuries, but what's left is immaculately maintained, and the gardeners should be congratulated on their choice of plants and  colours. The views are also breathtaking."
"Nice day out"
"Lovely walks and steep steps not for the faint hearted. Walk along the river and into the town. Lots of nice cafes and bakerys."
"Knaresorough castle is ace"
"Slight caveat: I've been to K'boro castle more times than you've had hot dinners, me bein' a K'boro lad an' all; that said, it is deservedly number 1 of 6 (6!!!!) attractions in K'boro. Why, you scream? Coz it's old, steep, beautiful, quirky, has some golf, allows wheelchair access, is close to centre of K'boro and looks over the river Nidd."
"Exit through the secret passage"
"My parents and I visited last may and the tour was awesome.  The guide had us exit through a secret passage. It was a little slippery but fun.  There is a wonderful coffee shop next door with the best scones.  It was a cold wet day so scones and tea were perfect."
"Day Trip"
"Went on a day trip to Knaresborough, which is a lovely place to visit. We did not go into the castle but walked around the beautiful gardens."
"Million-dollar views"
"This castle overlooks the river, viaduct and some very cute houses. Makes for a gorgeous afternoon walk. One of the most impressively beautiful places I have visited. Perfect quiet afternoon."
"windy but great view."
"Stopped of in Knaresborough on our way to Harrogate and was pleasantly surprised at the view from the Castle and it,s history."
"Lovely view"
"It is a stunning view from the castle, but we felt that since the castle is in ruins, it should be free to walk through it. Definitely worth walking up there though, the bridge is breathtaking. "
"Not fully open"
"Only 1/3/14 so start of the season, we were able to look round public areas though which was good....and free!"
"Lancastrian in Yorkshire"
"all ok site seeing around the castle. then we went into the town centre shops and all people were very friendly. We will be back soon, PS my wife is going to take her mother to Knaresborough for summer holiday(Hows that)"
"Good views, and an interesting piece of history"
"Some ruins of the old castle with good views down the valley of the River Nidd passing through Knaresborough. Historical information about the castle is interesting, and the grounds are clearly well looked after. Worth a walk up to look around."
"great walking"
"Great area to visit especially if I like walking don't miss drakes fish and chips best everthe castle was on a hill so difficult to get to get to the top if you have mobility problems but the walk is so worth the effort "
"Knaresborough in winter"
"Pleasant Yorkshire town with a ruined castle and grounds overlooking the river Nidd. The grounds are suitable for all and there is access to the valley by stairs or a steep path ( need to be ""fit if pushing a wheelchair, buggy etc) during summer months it is possible to rent boats on the river and to admire the railway viaduct from a different angle. Loads of places to eat in the town. Most facilities can be found in or around the Castle Park."
"Good views"
"Lovely view over the river and easy walking from the town centre and along the river but the castle is only small  "
"castle-tastic!"
"a real castle!! although it is in ruins! my son likes running around it and peeping in and out of different bits. In the past I have been on the dungeons tour and the underground tunnel and I think they are cool. I love the view from up here of the viaduct and river, although that is not a very good spot to sit with little ones who want to run around as there is quite a low wall with steep drop over the side."
"Stunning views, not much to do in winter"
"Little is left of Knaresborough Castle but the site is situated on top of a hill with beautiful views towards the viaduct over the River Nidd which are absolutely stunning. The remains of the castle are given signage explaining what part of the castle they were and their use during the castle's occupation. These signs are clear and informative.It is a shame that tours and the museum are only open Easter to September as there is little to see or do outside of these times. There are also organised tours during the summer months which offer the option of exploring additional areas such as the secret tunnels for moving troops. It is a pleasant walk around the site (which is mostly accessible for those with additional mobility needs) at any time of year though."
"Magnificent view"
"The view from the castle is reason enough to visit, but there is also the museum and the castle can be visited on certain days."
"Great views, not a lot of the castle left"
"As long as you know what to expect it's good. Most of the castle is gone, well battered over the years. The 'dungeon' was in fact a storage area but more fun for kids as the former."
"History up close"
"This is worth taking a look at as there is quite a bit of history and also, some amazing views of the River Nidd that runs below through Knaresborough."
"Worth it for the views"
"Know in advance that this is a ruin. After all, it’s getting on for 900 years old. There are no rooms to explore, just the remains of walls, with one exception - a courthouse from Elizabethan times which is now a museum. The grounds themselves are now a park.But being a castle, it’s set high up, on a cliff, in fact, and that gives it great views of the surrounding area, especially the railway viaduct going over the River Nidd."
"Take in a magical view."
"The castle doesn't really offer much to a visitor but what it does have that every visitor cannot miss is the spectacular view from the castle grounds overlooking the river and the now famous railway viaduct.Take it in,savour it and go home with a beautiful memory of Knaresborough and its castle."
"Great views"
"Not much left of the castle itself, but well worth strolling around for the views across the river and town."
"A spectacular viewpoint!!"
"Whilst the leaves are still on the trees the views from the Castle grounds overlooking the Nidd are fantastic. Do make for the Tourist Office tucked away in the shopping arcade in the market square which is on the right along the High Street which you turn right into off the A59 as you enter from Harrogate. There you can get a free map to find your way around. The Moat Buttery adjacent to the Castle grounds entry by the gate ruins is good. "
"Nice for a short visit..."
"Went there this Wednesday and had a look around.. Short but sweat! Great Wednesday Market, to bag a bargain! "
"Nice for a short visit..."
"Went there this Wednesday and had a look around.. Short but sweat! Great Wednesday Market, to bag a bargain! "
"Lovely river views"
"While there is not much of the Castle left, there are fantastic views of the bridge and a lovely walk to the river. There are some chaing looking cafes and houses on the river walk. Well worth a short stop if you are travelling nearby."
"Stunning"
"You get stunning views of the River Nidd. You can walk down the steps to the river and there are boats for hire or you can just wander round the castle ruins."
"Not much to see if you like looking round castles"
"Not much to look at only a tower, hardly worth paying to go up a few steps and down again, the view however, from the gardens across the river was lovely."
"Wow..."
"Even the grounds are enough to make your mouth go all agape like.The view of the famous viaduct and river in Knaresbourough beneath is utterly stunning."
"Stunning views"
"A really interesting walk round the castle, the views were fantastic, there was a lady dressed as a knight with big black raven birds ( I think that's what they were) i think you could have photographs taken with them as she had a collection box, all in all def worth a visit."
"Scontagious scones!"
"We stopped at the Scontagious stand in the car park and enjoyed a cream tea (your choice of scone, jam, clotted cream and hot drink for £2.50) Lovely ladies and excellent service. Would highly recommend before your big walk around the area."
"Great views"
"Loved the spectacular views over the river. Beautifully kept gardens and a fitting place for a war memorial."
"mixed blessings"
"Knaresborough is surely the quintessential old english village a must surely for any overseas visitor or UK residents who have never thought of it as a destination.Back in the days of King John in 1210 the Royal Charter for a weekly market and the distribution of Maundy money, the castle stands high above magnificent views of the Gorge and the lower village with a view equal in my humble opinion to that of roquemador in france.The lovely old buildings are so well preserved with the oldest Chemist shop in the country 1720,the manor house built around an Oak tree with a 400 yr old mulberry tree, then there is Mother Shiptons cave with its petrified well where she lived in the days of Henry viii, as a ""seer"" foretelling future events with a fair degree of accuracy. Statue of blind jack who lost his sight in 1723 at the age of 6 and still went on to be a famous engineer and roadbuilder,in the castle grounds is the unique old original courtroom, there is sooo much more and the ""natives"" are so friendly and helpful, and a hot tip park at the top of the town opposite the swimming pool where it is £1.60 for 10hrs!!!"
"Amazing well preserved castle"
"This 900 year old castle still has much of its roof, room and stairs in tact.  It is a fascinating testament to preservation.  I had my dog with me so couldn't stay to listen to all the narratives in each part of the castle, but we both enjoyed wandering around the interior."
"Well Kept Grounds and Great Views"
"Took our young grandson here yesterday to let him have a wander around and play on the grass, the area is very well kept and the flower beds still in good condition for the time of year. The views from the castle grounds looking down onto and up the river are just great, they must be one of the most photographed scenes in the area. Well worth visiting if you are in the area but please note if you intend taking your dog, they must be kept on leads at all times whilst in the grounds, also in Castle Yard just opposite, there is a nice little cafe called ""The Moat Buttery Tea Shoppe"" also worth a visit. Be wary of the long walk down (and then back up) if you want to go to the riverside, steep paths and steps are involved, I would suggest after visiting the castle grounds that you drive down to the car park at the end of Waterside for your river visit, go down Gracious Street and turn right just before the bridge, the cheap car park is about 400 yards on the left."
"You can enjoy the view without it costing anything"
"Part of our recent visit to Knaresborough saw a nice visit to the castle.....Most of the park in which you find it is free...I think you have to pay to go into the remaining tower but we have never bothered.Car park next door is excellent value...£1.60 for 4 hoursThe highlight has to be that view...absolutely stunning looking down the Nidd towards the railway viaduct"
"One of the Oldest Castle in Yorkshire"
"Although in ruins now. It has plenty of History. Guided tours regularly available. Worth going down into the dungeon. Fantastic views over the River Nidd. Lovely Ice Cream, Bakery and Fish and Chip shops and Pubs nearby."
"A steep walk from river but worth it."
"The view from the castle is amazing but it is a steep walk if approaching from the river.  The keeper of the ravens was there when we visited & this made our visit extra special."
"A wonderful place of historical interest"
"We spent a morning in Knaresborough and visitied the Castle. The ruins are awesome and command a wonderful view over the river to the next ridge. There were plenty of places to sit and contemplate the view and it was very peaceful. "
"summer 2013"
"Loved our visit to knaresborough ,ancient market town with good shops, enjoyed the walk round the castle ruins which was FREE ! the views of the river and viaduct are beautiful.Met the raven lady dressed in period costume with her talking ravens ! and her very nice husband who was very informative about the history of the ravens.Cant wait for our next visit !"
"Fantastic!"
"Lived in Knaresborough since 1997; many, many photos of the castle and viaduct. O will never tire of such a beautiful place."
"Not bad...."
"....but doesn't warrant being the No. 1 attraction in Knarebro'.  I much preferred 'The Well'.  The castle is a ruin, quite small.  We took the guided tour and the girl was very informative-would suggest you do this.  There is a secret tunnel which kids would love but steps down to it and uneven floor so wear flat shoes and be careful.  Steps down to dungeon aswell.  Entrance prices not bad but if we had not done the guided tour, would have only been in there for about 5 mins because it is so small.  Staff friendly."
"Delightful Knaresborough"
"Just got back from a visit to Knareborough. Set on the river Nidd this lovely ancient market town never fails to delight.It has many attractions including the famous Mother Shiptons wishing well.You can take a boat on the lovely river Nidd and enjoy rowing down the river. Or picnic in the grounds of the ruined castle.Then you could wonder around the shops including the Oldest Chemist property in the square.Not forgetting to have a cup of Yorkshire tea and cake to finish your visit."
"A great little secret"
"Hidden behind the main market square we came across this little gem. Small but perfectely formed, full of children enjoying themselves, oldies enjoying the view over the river and watching the trains on the aqueduct. We then wlked down to the river on the steep paths but the walk and the cafe's at the bottom were well worth the hike!We found the castle and its are delightful."
"worth a visit"
"excellent location good fixer upper opportunity, But really worth the visit with stunning views and easily accessable"
"superb Views"
"Loved the views of the river and the viaduct.Able to park at the castle where there are also public toilets.Great accesss to the town and down to the river."
"But make sure to play golf as well!!"
"Knaresborough is a great little place to visit and very close to Harrogate as wellMake sure to go play the pitch and put golf that is close to Knaresborough castle as its a great few hours!Once again be aware of the expensive ice cream vanPitch and put is only about £6 each so not expensive either!"
"Amazing"
"Great well kept Castle, the grounds are beautiful, and it has spectacular views over the river . Wonderful peaceful place to sit and relax."
"Interesting tour"
"Arrived just as a guided tour was starting. It was very informative and included a walk through the Sally Port."
"A nice hour or so away from the town....."
"A nice castle and tour......the sallyport was the most interesting part.....I would have liked for the stocks to be open and trap my partner inside but it was nice.....the river just below has rowing boats and on a sunny day a nice drink and boating is just the ticket"
"Very interesting"
"Had a good tour of the castle very ,good guide, went down the Sallyport which was very interesting! Really enjoyed seeing the rare spiders in the castle too. Tudor court was interesting and lovely solid oak."
"well worth a visit"
"we visited knaresborough recently and a walk up to the castle is lovely. Lots to see and you can even have a game of bowls. The views from the castle are wonderful  too"
"Peaceful with Stunning Views"
"A lovely place on a lovely day with views to lift your spirit. Not much castle to see now but it is free with plenty of places to sit and enjoy those views."
"Excellent"
"We had a lovely tour and walk around the castle and the museum is interesting. There were people whom dress up there and they give you the history. The weather was also lovely when we visited and there is a crasy golf and bowling green within the castle walls. "
"Breathtaking vista"
"Stunning views to take in from the castle to the river and valley below. Breathtaking vista. The little town is charming. A place you can sit quietly with a cuppa and a sandwich, breathe deeply, feast your eyes on the view below and watch the world drift by. Well worth a long look see. "
"Very good value"
"A ticket for £3.20 gets you into the castle and the museum, not bad really.The castle was the best of the two attractions..There`s not much of it left but what there is is good.The area around the castle and looking down the gorge to the river Nidd is good.Lady in grounds dressed rather strange with magpie and rooks on tethers, bit strange.Knaresborough itself is well worth a visit."
"A pleasant place for a stroll, with superb views"
" The castle itself is a ruin, just a small tower really, and there is very little to see inside it.  However, the castle gardens (which are free) are always really beautiful and it's a pleasant place for a stroll - with superb views over Knaresborough and the river.  There is also an interesting museum on the site.  In fact, it's worth paying for the museum visit, but I didn't think the castle was good value for money."
"great place"
"great place to visit, kids can race round, gardens around are lovelycan see over the walls down to the river, great view"
"Amazing view!!"
"Not very big or that much to do but the view down was well worth the climb up. Go on a clear sunny day.You can pay to go in the castle, this we did not do due to it being so busy."
"Kids Love a Castle"
"We went round the museum and signed up for the tour, kids loved it, dark underground passages with spiders, wife was not so sure about the spiders though."
"Wonderful views"
"Cheap to visit the museum and castle and full of interesting facts plus the views are gorgeous. Nothing to dislike except that it would have been better if it hadn't been dismantled."
"Good place to visit"
"Lovely gardens with some great views.  Ideal place to walk around in good weather.  Didn't visit inside the castle, well what there is of it, but will save that for another day."
"Awsome View"
"Great place to relax in the sunshine..the view is fantastic, always like to see the faces of people who have never seen it before. Once seen never forgotten."
"Small castle, but nice area."
"The castle itself is less accessible than others (see Middleham castle for a nicer/larger ruin) but the park and the long stairs down to the riverside are a fun area to walk around in."
"Historic town"
"come to Knaresborough this quaint little town, with history that goes back centuries, from mother shiptons cave {if you dare?} to the castle ruins, and a town well worth coming to see, with plenty of eating places, and lots of interesting shops to brose, from the well known charity shops to the little   brick-a-brack shops for all to enjoy"
"The kids loved it"
"Great ellevated setting overlooking the river and railway bridge. The kids loved running around the well tended grounds pretending to be knights. Look out for special events on at the castle over the summer months. Knaresboorough overall is a great place to wander around with coffee and ice creams by the river a popular spot."
"Great on a sunny day"
"Lovely views, great if you can find a bench - very basic pitch and putt and a nice view over the River Nidd. Can't ask for much more for free. Sometimes there are ""historical shows"" on, which are quite entertaining. Great on a lazy day."
"A hidden Gem"
"A bit of a hidden gem and for first time visitors a most pleasant surprise. Plenty of space to picnic and or relax and very photogenic - especially the view across the River Nidd Gorge and the railway viaduct. Plenty to see and do in Knaresborough and some really good walks but beware steep access for not so able. Whatever your abilities a wonderful place to visit at anytime of the year... "
"Amazing Views"
"Lovely setting and magnificent views, lots of meandering paths to follow, worth a visit, a steep walk down the steps to the river but worth the walk."
"What a beautiful place"
"Although the castle is but a ruin it is in the most beautiful setting, high on a hill  looking down over the river,  there is also a museum and remembrance garden, beautiful grounds and plenty of benches and places to sit and enjoy a picnic. There was even a lady Knight at the castle wall with three ravens, stop and talk to her she is most interesting.Pam tevens"
"Great views of the town!"
"This place was spectacular! We went to Knaresborough to do some sightseeing and this was one place we stopped off. The day we went was hot and sunny- it provided gorgeous views! We parked at Mother Shiptons and walked through the town- you can easily walk to all of the attractions once you park somewhere. There are different paths to get up to the castle from different sides- some steps and some ramps. Half way up the way we went there was a small pool for kids surrounded by gardens. The gardens on the whole are very well kept! There is not much left of the castle itself but the walk was lovely and there are museums at the top. At the museum, you had to pay for entry but we were happy enough walking outside and picture taking/ taking in the sights. You could see the trains crossing the bridge opposite- the row boats along the river below (which we did rent £5 per person an hour). There were plenty of benches to sit and relax as well- and lots of restaurants both at the top and along the river. Great as part of a walk through the town- but not enough to fill the entire day. Was definitely worth it!"
"Great day out."
"The river where you can take a boat out, the park and gardens and the views are all to be admired. We watched a bongo band in the park, that was a bonus. This is a lovely place for all ages."
"Extremely pleaseant"
"This a beautiful place, Castle grounds are very well kept, from here you can walk down the hill to the riverside.there are quite a few places to eat and drink near the castle at the top.Theres not enough at the castle for a day but if you walk down the hill along the river there are some great walks, all told it would make a great day out."
"Super detached property"
"The grounds are magnificent and impressively groomed. The ironwork around the grounds is most interesting.It is climb, not too far, from the riverside but is well worth it. The ruins are very interesting."
"Lovely Location"
"There isn't very much of this castle left unfortunately but still well worth a look around. It is in a beautiful location with cracking views over the town."
"Olde Worlde"
"There may not be very much of this castle now but you will have a guided tour by the best tour guide ever. Really knowledgeable man, makes the tour really enjoyable. Also a small museum here, also worthy of looking round."
"terrific location; exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable guide"
"Beautiful views over river; handy location in town centre; original Tudor courtroom and secret tunnel were fascinating; guide was extremely helpful, delaying her lunch to tell us about the tower, and then giving us our own private tour of the tunnel when we missed the official one"
"2nd visit"
"Love Knaresborough,this was our second visit,it is so picturesque and tranquil just to sit in the castle grounds looking down onto the river"
"Perfect place to visit on a nice day"
"We had a lovely stroll round the castle grounds although we didnt pay to go inside because the weather was so lovely. Then we braved the steep steps down to the river, walked along the river, came back for a cup of tea in one of the riverside cafes and then took a very deep breath and walked back up the steps! Phew, quite a climb, but not a long one thankfully. Not for those with dodgy knees or hips though. It was a beautiful day when we visited and the walk along the river was lovely and the views down to the river for the castle walls were fantastic. Good for a picnic."
"very historic, and beutiful location."
"Very well preserved historic relic.I fully under stand why they built it here, great views and easy to defend."
"Free day out"
"Lucky enough to be here when they had a @medievel day', excellent displays of wood carving, music, theatre, battle reenactment etc, and all free!"
"A Pleasant walk around the castle Grounds"
"It was a very sunny day & the castle location was ideal for a walk & picnic with a lovely views over the valley towards the stone rail viaduct. "
"Well it is not really a castle anymore, but do not miss it..."
"It has been here since the 13th century, but has been decimated by all the authorities in the intervening years , and there is very little left to discover.  What  IS wonderful here is the walkway that winds it's way from here to the River Nidd below. Walk down from here and then wander around the area for a hour or more and then return via a cute cobbled path just the other side of  the bridge [ on the same bank ] which will bring you out at the quaint railway station and the entry to the other side of the square. Families will love this outing as there are lots of adventurous things to do for the kids."
"Anywhere in Knaresborough - is a stones throw from The Castle Ruins"
"I sneeked a normally unseen view of our famous Knaresborough Castle a few Sundays past - after attending worship in the MAGNIFICENT  Anglican church.  From the Church Hall's back door there was a superb view of the Railway bridge and the castle beyond on the skyline.We then climbed up the hillside through the gardens, from the river - to come out right beside the Information place, the Castle ruins and endless ice-cream opportunities and Blind Jack awaiting us in the Market Place......!"
"Beautiful views"
"Famous views of Knaresborough riverside can be seen from Knaresborough Castle. Benches are suitably placed, and can provide a beautiful place to eat lunch or just relax.The Castle museum is also very interesting and provides a breif history of Knaresborough and the famous Blind Jack."
"Ruins Really"
"There's not much of the castle left to see but the ruins stand in attractive grounds with a very good view of the river below and a lovely small adjacent garden."
"Lovely walks along both sides of the river."
"Found a children's garden and play area on the ""other"" side of the river from where we parked.  We came back over the bridge and walked down to the cafes and boating area.  Too cold to stay out any longer, we stopped in at the café on the edge of the riverbank and went into their log-fired area and enjoyed a lovely meal.  Then a brisk walk back to the car.  Lovely day we had."
"Romantic ruin"
"Although the castle is a ruin, it's very atmospheric especially in the evening as the sun sets. Also it has the best view in Knaresborough!"
"Fascinating history of Knaresborough"
"Knaresborough Castle is definitely a must-see if you are visiting the town...  Very deep history and beautiful views over the Nidd River."
"cold visit to knaresborough"
"the weather was cold and wet but the location and scenery were fantastic.   shame it was so cold and miserable that all you wanted to do was get in somewhere and have a hot drink...and this was June!"
"The View"
"The view of the viaduct is amazing well worth a visit. The grounds are immaculate.  Views of Knaresborough outstanding"
"An afternoon stroll from the centre of town"
"In lovely weather it is a delightful place to stroll and picnic and to enjoy the views before descending into the river valley for wonderful walks."
"Picturesque"
"Lovely views and a great place to sit and relax. Bit of a climb up from the river however it is worth it when you get there. Castle does not open every day and there are obly a couple of rooms and the dungeons but still worth a visit and part of a great day out in knaresborough  "
"wow  what veiws"
"I love it here  the castle  ect good you can  park here   small carpark t oilets here and nice small café  scones excellent ,if you are disabled the views are stunning  there is a path  to get to river side or an other one by castle . the café s on riverside nice icecream great and loverly walks  you can spend a day here , market Wednesday great"
"Steep in history"
"We went around with family of all ages & everyone was interested in the history.Knaresborough Castle is surrounded by lovely grounds "
"Amendment to my review 3rd July 2012"
"This is an amendment to my review I made last year, unfortunately I put that the Castle was built in 1312 which should read ""finished in 1312""."
"what a view!"
"This is well worth a visit, just for the view. Free entry and it was interested. Even had a resident drunk who was shouting and slurring (we went at 10AM!) "
"Not that impressed!"
"Not that impressed but plenty of lawned areas to sit and have an ice cream or fish and chips on a nice sunny day."
"Nice if you're going to Knaresborough"
"We visited the castle as we had been to Mother Shiptons caves round the corner.  It is a nice castle but not much to see.  If you happen to be in Knaresborough have a look but I wouldn't go out of my way.  Only spent about 30-40 minutes there.  The best bit was when we were about to leave one of the staff asked if we wanted to see the secret tunnel.  That was very cool!!!"
"Breathtaking views"
"Take the camera for the view, which is exceptional. But the castle ruins are not particularly inspiring. The chargeable attractions, the tower and museum, dont hold too much of interest.A nice place to spend a couple of hours, but nothing more"
"Iconic views"
"Fantastic views of the river Nidd below from the cliff top.  This Castle although in partial ruins is a great place to visit whilst in the area. The market town of Knaresborough  is steeped with other attractions and local history.  Close to Harrogate, York, Ripon and the Dales"
"Knaresborough Castle"
"Very nice visit.People helpful with explanation.The whole village is very pleasant.Nice place for lunchNot too hard to find a parking place.Steep walk to the bottom of the gorgeGood to visit in the summer."
"weekend stay"
"Historic castle, a small museum (small charge ) peaceful lovely views over looking the river, seats all around and 3 mins from market place worth a walk around"
"Quaint old castle"
"Very small to what I expected, gardens good and the view amazing. You can take the step's down to the river and walk along interesting building's."
"Great views of river"
"You can get most of the impression from a stroll in the gardens and then down to the river via the zig zaags"
"lovely"
"there's not much to see in truth but there is a dungeon and buying a ticket allows entry to the very good little museum opposite.  then walk down the stairway to the riverside for one of the best walks anywhere."
"Historic monument with great views of the river"
"Such a peaceful location at the edge of the town. I wish dog walkers would take more responsibility."
"Birthday trip"
"Excellent views from the castle area. Lots to do in the Knaresborough area. Conventient parking and some excellent walks along the river, through the Nidd Gorge"
"great history"
"go for a nice drive in the country,look round the picturesque little village,and go and soak up some history.set in in scenic countryside include it on a stroll round all the other attractions,who dosn,t love a castle/"
"Who was the lady of the castle"
"We was surprised....the admission was cheap an included both the castle and a museum we preferred the castle although only a ruin was great to experience especially the dungeon...The museum had loads of information maybe too much.......The view from the castle to viaduct was well worth the visit"
"Scones to die for at ' Scontagious '  !!"
"On holiday in Knaresborough we were looking for a snack and drink, and we came across  a catering mobile , down by the River Nidd, on the opposite side of the road to Mother Shiptons. I had a  delicious cheese scone (warm and buttered) and my husband enjoyed some  buttered crumpets. The friendly  ladies make  you feel very welcome .      We  can guarantee you will not be disappointed."
"Lots of fun!"
"This castle is so cool! During our 6 month stay in the neighboring town of Harrogate, we visited Knaresborough Castle 4 times. The tour guides are very knowledgable and the tour is very interesting. the castle (or what remains of it) is rather small, so the tour isnt that long. The cost is very reasonable and with the price you get admission into the courthouse museum as well, which is very interesting. The grounds are beautiful and the scenery is amazing. If you want a REALLY cool photo, go up to the castle and take one looking down toward the River Nim. Stunning to say the very least. There have been countless paintings done of that exact scene. Just down a path is a lovely wading pool for kids to play in when the weather is nice. Pack a picnic and sit on the bowling green. Make a day of it, it's truly a special place."
"Sensational views"
"On a drizzly grey April day the views from the castle still managed to impress -  the river way below with rowing boats bobbing gently, the stunning bridge perfectly reflected in the water, and the pretty houses of the town between the trees beyond. The remains of the castle walls were sturdy and imposing, and I could imagine peacefully whiling away an afternoon wandering across the lawns, admiring  the views, if only the weather had been warmer. Definitely a highlight of our whistlestop tour of North Yorkshire."
"High on A Hill.........!"
"Wonderful views down the River Nidd from the courtyard of this Castle. Easy walking from town centre, we found it easy to park and quite cheap. Visitors can walk round the pleasant courtyard, benches to have a picnic, dogs welcome. We didn't pay to go into the castle tower and court room, as quite busy and limited for time, but children seemed to be enjoying themselves. Knaresborough is very pleasant with plenty to see and do."
"An 'OK' place to kill an hour or so."
"The castle is a little misleading (ruins more like). Takes about 10mins at a stretch to walk around the lot. The associated museum was a little better and the quiz managed to entertain the youngsters for 30mins. Good views on a warm day, of the river."
"Castle ok but more in meuseum"
"It was ok and the tour made it more interesting, we were taken down what was called a sallyport that they used to go down and come out and suprise any enimies that were attacking the castle. The museum was interesting and was good for kids, they can draw and colour a picture in of a knight,and also try medievil costumes,it,s worth a visit."
"Beautiful view from either below or above the river"
"Knaresborough Castle stands proud on the cliffs above the River Nidd at Knaresborough.  You can either visit from the town itself or climb the steps up from the riverside walk.  Either way the views from the castle walls looking down to the river are spectacular.  There is lots of seating available to rest during your visit and take in the surroundings or to rest after the climb.As with all visits to North Yorkshire make sure you have good footwear and warm clothing as the weather is so changeable.  "
"Nice view but that is about it."
"I wouldnt bother making a special trip but the view over the river etc is fab. Not much 'to' the castle but pleasant gardens surrounding it."
"Excellent staff promoting it"
"Wasn't too bad price and the lady who took our money was lovely and we kept seeing her at the museum too!!"
"Good when the wind doesnt blow"
"Its worth a visit in the summer but dont expect guides or much information but the view over the river and town is worht the trip"
"Great Views"
"Fantastic views down into the river & railway viaduct, nearly killed myself walking down to the riverside, we were advised by the hotel to walk down the river & up to the castle but chose to do the other way round."
"Knaresborough"
"The quaint houses perched on the side of the steep slopes leading to the river.  Definitely worth another visit"
"great views!"
"As others have said, the views from here are outstanding and the walk down to the river is lovely.  Not much castle left but all quite pleasant set amongst attractive gardens.  did not experience any problems with dog mess"
"Great Castle remains"
"Loved it !!! great view over the river.Jjust a little bit cold.  Will come back in the Summer. Looking forward to it. "
"A Blast from the past."
"Interesting to see history.  Sadly the castle no longer intact but still worth the visit.  Also Slingsby bloody shirt he wore at his be heading."
"Scenic and interesting spot"
"Very pleasant grounds rising up above the River Nidd towards Knaresborough town centre. Plenty of walks and views.  Boating on the river. The Castle looks worth an internal visit but it was just closing when I arrived! Grounds are free but charge for Castle itself  I think."
"ruins and a view"
"beautiful views across the river especially in the evening, not a lot left of the castle but definitely worth a look if you are in the area. the walk by the river is always a pleasure especially on a nice day."
"Great Views"
"The views towards the railway viaduct and the river Nidd are fantastic which is an added bonus, after walking around up top you can carefully walk down towards the river where a welcome coffee or tea can be taken at one of several cafes, and in season watch the rowing boats on the river. If you wish, you can then walk along the footpaths either side of the road bridge or up the town, which in itself is a well worth trip, visit the oldest chemist shop in the market square or one of several pubs waiting to give you a good Yorkshire welcome."
"Dog toilet"
"First time visiting Knaresborough today and stumbled across the Castle. I have to say the view was lovely but having to wade through the piles of dog mess on the lawns was very very off putting.This was despite the signs saying that it was a poop a scoop area and bins being provided. DISGUSTING!"
"Wow What views"
"The walk from the top to the bottom is a must. Then a cup of tea in the cafe at the bottom, watching everyone out on their rowing boats."
"Fantastic views."
"It  is surprising that you can just wander in free to these lovely castle grounds, with very well-kept gardens which overlook the River Nidd and its iconic viaduct. The town and castle have royal connections to King Edward 3 and his Queen Philippa."
"Worth a nose around"
"I like looking at ruins of castles, and while there's not a lot left of it, I think it looks fascinating and there are some beautiful views.  Best of all it's free, and the surrounding town is nice to explore as well."
"Take a tour"
"This is set in gardens near the town centre. It is small but the museum is interesting, take a tour otherwise you will miss out."
"Great Views of River etc."
"Knaresborough is well worth your time spent visiting.  Another unique Yorkshire attraction.  Not so much of this castle remains but great views of river down below and railway bridge at some height across. "
"Wonderful views"
"A well preserved ruin in well kept grounds with beautiful views over the River Nidd and railway viaduct. No entrance fee! There is also a museum on site"
"worth a visit"
"visit on a nice day-very exposed and windy !!!! scenic area but not a lot left unless perhaps you go down the hill"
"archiology"
"the guides really bring the place to life, it must have been a buseling place in its time with lots of businesses supporting the castle"
"Great attraction with great views."
"Lovely old castle very close to the town centre. Very cheap parking in town too! The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because you're not allowed access to the small section of remaining castle. Other than that it's fantastic!"
"Lovely town"
"Interesting castle to visit and close to the town. Took some fab photos of the river below and the bridge reflected in it. Be sure to look round the town and find ""the town windows ""- a hint -look upwards! Also find the statue of ""Blind Jack"" - sit next to him!"
"Beautiful"
"Lovely for a wander, even on a chilly winter's day. I'm glad I took my camera as the views of the river were lovely. It was nice and close to the rest of the town too."
"Very pretty"
"Good family day out. We have spent many a Sunday wandering around the castle - picnicing in the summer and making snowmen in the winter. Very pretty and inexpensive day out."
"Great views and space to walk around"
"A must if you like river/scenic views with ease of access to the town centre - great choice of small shops, cafes, antique shops, etc.There is an excellent walk down Abbey Road that runs alongside the riverside and on warmer days you might be enticed to go boating."
"FANTASTIC VIEWS"
"The best views in the UK from the castle over river. Don`t go without your camera. Visit the dungeon if you dare. Restoration work in progress but should not spoil your enjoyment. Large car park at side."
"Worth a visit"
"The area is steeped in history and the gorge with the River Nidd flowing through it is very scenic, very picturesque"
"Very interesting"
"Free to walk around the ruins. You can feel the history just being there! Knaresborough town is lovely too."
"Ruins not a castle"
"Please note that those are only ruins wall really but the position of it is very attractive and the views from there are spectacular. It is free to enter which is always good."
"great view"
"While the castle was interesting, it's small. The thing I loved was the incredible view behind it. A must see!"
"Nice place to visit"
"A lovely place to visit on a sunny day. There are plenty of places to get a cup of tea either in the town or along the waterside"
"Worth the Visit!"
"The woman in the TIC gave us a map and sent us on our way to the castle and we were certainly happy she did!  This is a fabulous ruin that is owned by the Queen and it is a splendid spot overlooking the river down below and the beautiful gardens within.  There is no charge (and that is the way it should be I always feel as far as ruins go) and you can use your camera til your heart's content; sit and read a book, sit and have your lunch...it is just fabulous."
"Fabulous views"
"Quite a steep walk from the riverside, but when you eventually get  up there the views are spectacular.  Also when we visited was a Raven display and these birds are really facinating!"
"Taz"
"Walked round the castle and along the path by the river ending at Old Mother Shipston Cave (which was closed due to the time of year). Pleasant walk"
"magnificent views"
"The views from the castle walls are wonderfully, along the river nidd. But there isnt very much left standing of the actual castle, and at times its closed to the public because it is unsafe. The gardens are ok, and there is a putting green and bowling green. The steps down to the riverside are not for the fainthearted! Nice cafes nearby and parking. Avoid wednesday, when its market day and the traffic and parking is awful"
"Good to see"
"Good to have seen it but would not make a special trip to visit. It has history but unfortunately there is not a lot left. Great views of the town tho. "
"Beat these views"
"A small ruined Castle loved by the locals,  Look down over the Nidd Gorge with it's viaduct and stand in awe .The market town of Knaresborough is historically older than it's better known neighbour of Harrogate"
"Great ruins"
"Great to see, a free location where you can walk around the castle and see an amazing view of the River Nidd."
"Fantastic view"
"Late autumn the colours on the trees are amazing and the view from the castle stunning? During winter there is only a little to do in the castle grounds, but the display boards are very informative. "
"Great Gardens, beautiful view."
"Really nice views, and a lovely garden with a paddling pool for the kids. All for FREE! The castle is mostly now in ruins, but still very interesting (whats left of it)"
"Fantastic views"
"Our visit was on a rather dull and damp day, but despite this the views of the river and surrounding area are quite stunning. The castle itself is largely a ruin and the museum is closed at this time of year (October) but there is still plenty to see. There are also some really good walks in and around the area -quite challenging as it is high on a hill - well it is a castle!As it is crown property, it's  a free attraction too."
"exciting to visit such an old castle ruin"
"what a great place to walk around, and the history is very interesting, with lots of information to find out and as well as things and rooms to visit"
"A must for your camera"
"A terrific view of the Nidd and Riverside. Buskers and even ravens on display. It was a lovely area just to walk around and to take photos from. It was probably the best vantage point of the river and viaduct in Knaresborough."
"Knaresborough Castle and Surrounding Area"
"The castle stands alongside the River Nidd in a scenic area of Knaresborough.When rating it as very good I considered the castle as an integral part of a very pleasant walk in the area."
"Lovely Castle"
"Knaresborough Castle is a ruined castle. Inside there is no pictures it is basically the shell of the building. The best part is the dungeon, it is has beautiful architectural archers coming out of the middle stone post. Upstairs on the top floor you are out on the open and there is nothing really to see except the chimney stack and the view from the top of this ruined castle. However when you get out of the castle the gardens are so lovely around it and the view from the castle is breathtaking. This is a must see if you go to Knaresborough."
"walk right in for best views"
"Plenty of pubs and eating places all around the market place. We ate at THE SPICE MERCHANT sat night be early it got very busy. visit blind jacks for great chioce of real ales."
"good for local events"
"The castle provides a wonderful setting for local events,such as the medieval days and music events.It is a natural ampitheatre, however one of the biggest attractions of the castle is the view from the grounds,looking down onto the river below.This is a much better view in winter,because the trees have been allowed to get too tall in front of the castle.I think it's high time there was a more permanent performance area ,such as a bandstand.There could be regular music events throughout the summer, as there are at the valley gardens and Wetherby riverside"
"Views"
"Very relaxing, nice people and tremendous views, very clean place and lots of interesting things to see and do.  Very well signposted with public car park close by."
"Great view"
"Free attraction, well worth a walk around to see the iconic view of the viaduct.  Lots of benches too."
"Superb views"
"We decided to visit Knaresborough on our way back form York after seeing the channel 4 programme ""3 in a bed"". we picked a lovely sunny day and so glad we stopped over. The views from the castle are breathtaking, the river Nidd with the viaduct in the centre make a beautiful picture and setting, we visited Mother Shipton which was a magical place to see. All in all Knaresborough is alovely place to see and stop off at."
"One of the most photographed views in the UK."
"Although there is a charge to visit the castle museum, entry to the castle grounds is free and present a wonderful opportunity to take in the famous view of the railway viaduct over the river Nidd. There are also views across to the Mother Shipton estate and down to the old water mill.The castle grounds are pretty, and well-kept and I would suggest that if you are visiting Knaresborough a stroll here is a must."
"Must visit if going to Knaresborough"
"On a sunny day, the views from the Castle are magnificent, with the view of the viaduct being probably one of the most photographed in Yorkshire.  The castle itself is small, but during spring and summer you can have a look around the inside and dungeons fairly inexpensively, along with the Sallyport and museum.  The tree-lined grounds are well-served with seating and it's a lovely place to sit and while away the time.  There is also a putting green for the little ones.  Not a huge place, but pleasant anyway and one you must visit if you haven't been to Knaresborough before."
"Hidden knaresborough"
"the situation on top of the river gorge amidst gardens - beautiful plus the history - close to town and our hotel. Shops and tourist office all friendly and near."
"History with a view"
"Lovely walk around the ruined castle.  Grounds well kept.  We could see Mother Shipton's well from the top.  Great area."
"Lovely for a day out"
"Long walks by the river, intresting Castle ruins, very nice market place and old shops, pubs and eaterys. only a few miles from Harrogate and only a short drive from the City of Leeds well worth a day out if the weather is kind"
"Beautiful views"
"We did not pay to go inside the castle ruins but we did enjoy the views of the viaduct from the castle grounds.  The scenery was beautiful and we enjoyed eating lunch on a bench whilst looking down on Knaresborough"
"A trip to the castle with superb views"
"A small museum,but well laid out,not a lot left of the castle,but enjoyed it,as did having an ice cream looking down on the river and viaduct,(excellent photograph material) "
"Love it here"
"The views are stunning and beautiful in a sunny evening when it's less busy. Lovely little cages and boats along the river. "
"Striking location"
"Knaresborough Castle looks dramatic, perched on a hill above the river Nidd. There's a £3.20 admission fee to get in to the museum on its surviving ground floor - the rest is a ruin - and if you're a castle fan and want to know more about its history then it's worth paying up. Alternatively you can stroll around the gardens in front of it for free and gaze out on the river Nidd and the viaduct spanning the valley below."
"Lovely views"
"We didn't go into the paying part of the Castle, but the area is very beautiful and the views over the river and the viaduct, (looking towards Mother Shiptons Cave area) are breathtaking.  "
"History - you always remember the naughty bits!"
"Wonderful to walk around the Castle grounds - the views are spectacular. Can't remember which King built it for his boyfriend but the King's 'Men' were not very impressed - hence the application of a hot poker......King, unsurprisingly, died! Google it!"
"Fascinating!"
"We really enjoyed our visit to Knaresborough Castle, the staff there were really friendly and very knowledgeable.  It wasn't too expensive to get in.  We all even got to dress up in medieval dress, the kids enjoyed that bit!! Definitely worth a visit!"
"beautiful views."
"Visited on a lovely sunny day ( not many of those this year) a lovely place to just sit with an icecream and watch the wildlife and boats on the river. Lovely."
"A Must Visit Place"
"The castle and town are a must to visit so much to see and do ,and so picturesque by the river and viaduct"
"Well maintained ruin"
"Had a very enjoyable visit to Knaresborough Castle today. There is a lot more to see than at first glance, the most substantial remains being of the keep or King's Tower. Quite a lot of architectural detail remains, including some fine vaulting. Look out for the medieval graffiti on the wall on your way down into the dungeon. Nice museum too, which includes an original Tudor court layout. Very reasonably priced and well kept, a big thumbs up to Harrogate Council who maintain it.Fantastic views across the river to the Knaresborough viaduct as well. Sadly I had to leave before the tours of the underground sally port or tunnel began, but all the more reason to come back.A big shout out to the staff as well, the friendly and knowledgable young lady at the castle and the two people running the museum. I was made to feel really welcome and it's clear they all have great pride in doing a great job.Well worth a visit, highly recommended!"
"A must when visiting Knaresborough"
"The castle and the museum had a great deal of history which was very interesting. Cheap admission prices too, which gives entry to the castle and the museum. Friendly, helpful staff. "
"Beautiful views"
"Only problem was it was closed but the gardens and the views were superb"
"Surprise Gem"
"Beautiful location.Not too big, went in the museum as well, had a lovely day.Would be good to take children as well."
"Views to die for"
"An amazing view from the ruins of the castle, very well looked after and a must see whilst visiting Knaresborough."
"Fantastic"
"The views are stunning from the Castle yard, we had lunch along by the river and just relaxed to take in the peace and quiet before a 5 hour drive home perfect."
"Our Castle and Viaduct"
"We live in Knaresborough and the Castle was built in 1312 and was used as a refuge from Scottish marauders in 1318, but later became the summer home for the Royal court of Edward III and his wife Queen Philippa. During the Civil War it was besieged by Parliamentarians and eventually succumbed in 1644. The grounds are beautiful and well kept.  The museum and Castle has a lot of history, there is a guide to take you round the castle and we found the things she told us about the past were amazing.  The views from the ramparts out to the Viaduct are fantastic, there are steps down to the riverside where there are cafes and boating."
"Love the views"
"Me and my partner live in ripon.and my parents live in knaresborough.we often visit on weekends but there's something about knaresborough I love...the views which can be seen from the castle,the relaxing cafes along the waterside.the atmosphere in the whole place makes knaresborough a beautiful town.the castle itself is nicely kept with plenty of seating to relax on after the walk up from the bottom.if you ever get the chance to go to knaresborough you must visit the castle."
"Fantastic View"
"I was brought up in Knaresborough and took the castle yard for granted as a youngster. I visit regularly and always head to the castle yard and stand and look at the view, it is just amazing and it does not matter what season you go it always looks fantastic and after more years than I would like to admit you can still spot something diffrent. I would without doubt put this as my number one place in the world and I have been to a lot of places. It is North Yorkshire at its best and I love it."
"Magical site"
"Live locally so walk there regularly. Fantastic views of the Nidd gorge and the medieval houses of Knaresborough that cling to the hillside. Breathtaking is the only word for it. "
"Good value"
"Interesting and good value for money. Great to walk around and good views over river and viaduct. "
"interesting place"
"Went to knaresborough on the bus,just 15mins from Harrogate.It is well worth a visit.We went on a wednesday which is market day.The market contained plenty of stalls selling local produce,including fruit and vegetables,fish,meat and cheeses.This made a pleasant change from the endless rows of jeans,trainers and handbags.The castle is about 5mins walk from the market and has some lovely views of the river and surrounding area.We would recommend this as a place worth a visit"
"lovely views"
"lovely grounds and information points. castle itself was closed when we visited. views across the valley/ river were great. you can go down to the river from the castle grounds but it is steep and uneven but worth the journey."
"Great day"
"kids enjoyed it lovely views, steeped in history loved it.."
"Lovely Views from here"
"This is the second time ive been to Knaresborough and somehow managed to completely miss the castle when i came the first time!  Gorgeous settings with amazing views of the whole of Knaresborough"
"great place"
"a lovely place to  visit plenty to see including mother shiptons well"
"Great Outlook"
"This is just a fab place to go for an afternoon walk with the dog. The castle is situated on top of a most attractive outlook over the river. Highly recommend for a family day out"
"Castle at Knaresborough"
"Excellent with a information placques containing much info on history.Also the gardens adjacent to it were beautiful!"
"Great"
"The guide was really informative and we learnt alot from him"
"Knaresborough"
"Knaresborough is a nice small town near to Nidd Hall, there isnt a great deal to see of the Castle but as it is situation very high up, the views over the river are absolutely beautiful"
"Our first stop!"
"When we moved to Harrogate, we had to deal with the jet lag, so our friend took us here to ""kill"" some time before we could go to sleep, what a great place to relax and have a cup of  coffee! The view is amazing!! My favorite place to take my friends visiting!"
"About Knaresborough (all the village and not only the castle)"
"Not amazing, but deffinitely worth a visit. The village is quite nice and pleasant to walk around. One full day is more than enough to wander around it's river, enjoy the lovely views from the castle (and the trains passing by the bridge, you don't want to miss that), have a pint, eat something and go back to wherever you came from. Small but lovely place and castle. Liked it."
"Beautiful scenery"
"Went to Knaresborough to see Mother Shipton's cave. To be honest, I found that disappointing, but the scenery in Knaresborough is beautiful and you get a very good view from the castle over looking the river. If you are looking for a nice day out in North Yorkshire, definitely worth a visit."
"Pass away half an hour"
"The castle is in ruins , but is a free attraction . It commands a prominent position with excellent views . Agood place to rest and have a picnic or sandwiches for lunch . You can then walk down by the river ."
"Nice walk through the grounds"
"The grassed area was obviously an attraction for dogs!"
"Knaresborough Castle"
"The castle is very nice, if you can really call it a castle; it is mostly just ruins now! The surrounding views are lovely and it is deffinately worth a visit if you're in Knaresborough and looking for something to see and do after the shops!"
"Nice views"
"Nice views, not much there to see and do due to the castle mostly being in ruins now, but a lovely place to see due to the outstanding view down the valley"
"What a view!"
"This is one of the most iconic views in North Yorkshire, which is very often seen in many calendars, because of  its impressive scenery."
"Fabulous views"
"Knaresborough castle is ideal for a quiet afternoon stroll. Walk around the old moat and the remains of the castle grounds. It is possible to tour the castle itself, though not much is left, but is worth a look if just for a tour down the old Sallyport (secret escape tunnel), though becareful with your footing down there!"
"Super"
"History really interesting and worth a visit, super views as well."
"Iconic view of Nidd Gorge and the railway viaduct..."
"This is an uplifting view from the castle grounds. Castle tour is interesting, particularly the Sally Port from where besieged Royalists - following rout at nearby Marston Moor - launched a secret attack on the Parliamentarians siege gun that was bombarding the weakened portcullis gate houses. Walk to Waterside to marigold cafe and boating for great food and the best seats in town!"
"Lovely gardens and view"
"Not much left but good gardens and fantastic view.Bang in centre with good footpaths leading everywhere!"
"Beautiful place."
"We went to go to mother shipdens which was good then took the walk up to the castle. It is a steep walk but well worth it, the castle is pretty and the view from the top was stunning although the castle entrance price was a little expensive and there isnt much to see inside but the children did enjoy it. Outside the castle theres a lovely grasses area great for a picnic."
"Don't pay to go in, appreciate from the outside."
"Perhaps you feel obliged to take the tour, but as the castle is not very intact there is little of the 'main building' left. However there are some interesting stories, particularly the secret tunnel. Very pretty perched on the cliff though."
"Good views but ...."
"What's left of it is interesting, but there's not much left. Views are spectacular as is the walk along the river with its boats, ice creams etc. Tough walk up from the main car park for the old folk though."
"freezing"
"what a lovely spot but not great on a cold day like today."
"Bit Dull"
"Not really much a day trip...Knaresborough has a few other things to do, river rowing and Mother Shiptons Cave..."
"Pretty Views in beautiful Yorkshire"
"Knaresborough is a beautiful, interesting little town in North Yorkshire, in itself well worth a visit. The Casle is its crowning glory, situated in the middle of the town wirh wonderful views down the ravine."
"Liked the castle - loved the view"
"The castle itself is not much more than a ruin, as you are unable to go inside. The architecture is fine, if you're into that kind of thing. For us, the best thing was the view over the valley and the bridge. Take a look, it's well worth it! "
"Stunning views."
"A nice bit of history to end our visit.  Stuning views from the castle.  Well worth a mooch around :)"
"Include in a visit to Knaresborough and the river, lovely in good weather"
"The walk along the riverside is well worthwhile of you have time."
"Not too much castle left now, but still worth a visit!!"
"There's not a lot of the castle left now, thanks to Cromwell, but there a still a few rooms in what vis left of the Keep, plus a museum, the former jail, and a complete underground Sally-port to interest to the visitor.  There is a small fee to visit the castle rooms, but not for the grounds.The castle has extensive grounds with tremendous views over the Nidd Gorge and the Nidd rail viaduct.  It's worth the visit for the views alone, especially from the vicinity of the War Memorial.  You can walk down through what was the moat, into Bebra Gardens and then down onto Waterside that runs alongside the river.  Turning right, you pass the old flax mills, under a huge cliff to the café's and toilets, boats are available for hire in season - just past the toilets there are steps back to the castle grounds, all 129 of them.  Continuing towards the viaduct you can return to the market place via Gallon Steps, or go under the viaduct and then back up to the market place via Waterbag Bank or you can bypass the cobbled hill by using the steps to the church which is really worth a visit."
"Great View"
"Not much of the castle left after Parliment made alterations with canons & gunpowder, and the locals scavenged the rest, but the views up and down the Nidd gorge, with the famous Nidd Viaduct, more than make up for the disappointment of the castle ruins."
"The view is lovely"
"Not much to see unfortunately but didn't view the museum so cannot comment on that aspect."
"Amazing views"
"A must to go and see the view out over knaresborough, absolutely beautiful!"
"castle with a view"
"Although a ruin the views over the river Nidd are not to be missed."
"Beautiful view"
"Liked the open space and the ease of the walk down to the river and back - a nice short circular walk"
"Picturesque"
"The castle offers great views over Knaresborough. The grounds are beautifully kept and while structurally there isn't a massive amount to see, what remains is fascinating (check out the ancient graffitti on the walls!) . Guided tour recommended, very informative and interesting and got the chence to walk through one of the sallyports."
"Picturesque site"
"This is a ruin. Wonderful for views over the gorge. Pleasant spot."
"A nice day out to see the Castle area and Knaresborough town."
"We returned for a visit to Knaresborough, this time with a coach party.   Previously just as a couple.  The castle grounds are always worth a visit especially for the spectacular views overlooking the gorge of the River Nidd.   The upstream view includes the imposing railway viaduct, (grade II listed).  The ancient Castle is largely a ruin now - result of the Civil War, but the keep is open to the public and for a modest charge, so is the old Courthouse which now serves as a museum.  Knaresborough town is worth spending time wandering round.  Note that the busy market day is a Wednesday.  One shop claims to be the oldest Chemist Shop in England!   Look out and 'up' to first floor level, for the 'Town Windows'!  A collection of paintings on property walls around the town, to create the effect of windows depicting a variety of figures - from a fighter pilot, to Old Mother Shipton, from King John to Zoo animals and several others.  Recommend a day out in Knaresborough, for the town, the Castle area,  Mother Shipton's Cave and the Petrifying Well and the Nidd Gorge."
"Well-located to associate with other attractions"
"Knaresbrough Castle is a ruin of small proportions but the grounds have been tended to and it provides a perfect viewing platform from which to view the river and viaduct. The latter carries the railway to and from a nostalgic station (worth a look-see). Close to the Market Square and with a great ice-cream shop round the corner, rest here a while, take photos, then amble down to the riverside for lunch or afternoon tea. Knaresbrough is in the disc parking scheme found in Yorkshire and discs are available from Tourist Boards and shops. Can spend half a day here in nice weather and travel on to other tourist sites in the vicinity, or stop by on the way from."
